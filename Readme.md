# AI Survey Simulation Platform

[![Demo Video](./market_research.png)](https://www.loom.com/share/88493cf639014566ab8c63f4b075792a)

## Overview

This platform simulates realistic survey responses by creating detailed persona profiles from real data. It generates nuanced, contextually appropriate responses that reflect how actual people with diverse backgrounds would answer surveys.

Built for market researchers and product teams, the system helps predict how different user segments might react to products, policies, or workplace changes without the cost and time of traditional surveys. Each virtual respondent maintains consistency across questions while exhibiting the natural variation found in human responses.

Key capabilities include parallel processing of multiple personas, theme detection across responses, sentiment tracking, and demographic insightsâ€”enabling detailed analysis without running a single real-world survey.

## Features

- **Persona-Based Response Generation**: Utilizes AI to create realistic personas from real data sources including employee reviews and product reviews.
- **Survey Simulation Engine**: Simulates survey responses across multiple personas simultaneously.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Provides detailed analysis of survey results, including sentiment analysis, theme identification, and response patterns.
- **Customizable Persona Types**: Supports multiple persona types (currently Intel employees and product reviewers).
- **Research Capabilities**: Enables deep research based on survey results and persona responses.
- **REST API**: Exposes functionality through a FastAPI-based REST interface.

## Usage

### Running a Survey Simulation

1. Define your survey questions in JSON format
2. Select the persona type (INTEL_EMPLOYEE or INTEL_PRODUCT_REVIEWER)
3. Use the `/survey/run` endpoint to run the simulation
4. Analyze the detailed results

Example API request:

```json
POST /survey/run
{
  "title": "Employee Satisfaction Survey",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "text": "How satisfied are you with the company culture?",
      "options": [
        {"id": "1", "text": "Very Satisfied"},
        {"id": "2", "text": "Somewhat Satisfied"},
        {"id": "3", "text": "Neutral"},
        {"id": "4", "text": "Somewhat Dissatisfied"},
        {"id": "5", "text": "Very Dissatisfied"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "persona_type": "INTEL_EMPLOYEE"
}
```

### Asking Individual Personas

You can also interact with individual personas to get more detailed responses:

```json
POST /ask
{
  "persona_index": 0,
  "question": "What do you think about the company's work-life balance?",
  "persona_type": "INTEL_EMPLOYEE"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "answer": {
    "response": "Based on my experience at Intel, the work-life balance is challenging. While the company does offer flexible working hours and some remote work options, the workload is often overwhelming. There's an unspoken expectation to be available outside regular hours, especially during product launches or critical projects. I've found myself working weekends more often than I'd like, which has affected my personal time. The competitive environment also creates pressure to put in extra hours to keep up with colleagues. That said, it does vary by department - some teams have better boundaries than others.",
    "sentiment": "somewhat negative",
    "key_concerns": ["workload expectations", "availability outside hours", "weekend work"],
    "confidence": 0.87
  },
  "persona": {
    "name": "David Chen",
    "role": "Senior Software Engineer",
    "rating": 3.2,
    "location": "Santa Clara, CA",
    "recommend": false,
    "employment_status": "Current Employee, 3 years",
    "pros": "Good benefits, interesting technical challenges",
    "cons": "Poor work-life balance, pressure to overwork"
  }
}
```

### Deep Research

The platform allows for deep research based on survey results:

```json
POST /research
{
  "query": "What factors contribute to employee satisfaction?",
  "breadth": 5,
  "depth": 3,
  "concurrency": 2,
  "survey_results": {...},
  "persona_responses": [...]
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "research_summary": {
    "key_findings": [
      {
        "title": "Work-Life Balance Impact",
        "description": "Work-life balance emerged as the primary factor affecting employee satisfaction across all departments",
        "confidence": 0.92,
        "supporting_evidence": "87% of respondents mentioned work-life balance in their comments"
      },
      {
        "title": "Management Recognition",
        "description": "Recognition from management significantly influences overall job satisfaction",
        "confidence": 0.85,
        "supporting_evidence": "Employees with positive sentiment mentioned managerial recognition 3.5x more often"
      }
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      {
        "title": "Implement Flexible Working Hours",
        "description": "Introduce more flexible working arrangements to improve work-life balance",

## Extending the Platform

### Adding New Persona Types

1. Define a new persona type in `schema.py`
2. Create data loading logic in `personas.py`
3. Implement prompt generation in `prompts.py`
4. Update the API endpoints in `server.py`

### Customizing Analysis

The analysis capabilities can be extended by modifying:
- `response_analytics.py` for quantitative analysis
- `qualitative_analytics.py` for theme identification
- `survery_meta_analysis.py` for meta-analysis


For cloud deployment, a `fly.toml` file is included for deployment on Fly.io.
