Someone responded that they wouldn\'t recommend the 14900 for gaming, and suggested the Intel Core i7-14700F 2.1 GHz 20-Core Processor instead.\n\nMy question is, does the CPU Thread Community here agree? More importantly, can you explain why? I just assumed, newer, faster, better...?\n\nI don\'t want something that\'s just good enough now. I want something that will be plenty good enough for at least a few years.\n\nMy prospective build, and what I\'m using it for below:\n\nCPU: Intel - Core i9-14900K Raptor Lake 3.2GHz Twenty Four-Core LGA 1700\n\nCPU cooler: Noctua - NH-D15S Chromax Black\n\nMotherboard: Gigabyte - Z790 AORUS Elite X WiFi 7 Intel LGA 1700 ATX\n\nRam: Corsair - Vengeance 64GB (2 x 32GB) DDR5-6000 PC5-48000 CL30 Dual Channel\n\nSSD/HDD: Crucial - T705 2TB Micron 232L TLC NAND PCIe Gen 5 x4 NVMe M.2 Internal SSD\n\nGPU: Gigabyte - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super Windforce V2 Triple Fan 16GB GDDR6X PCIe 4.0\n\nPSU: Lian Li - Edge 850 Watt 80 Plus Platinum ATX Fully Modular\n\nChassis: Lian Li - Lancool 216 Tempered Glass ATX Mid-Tower\n\nOS: Microsoft - Windows 11 Home 64-Bit FPP USB\n\nMonitor: MSI - MPG 321URX 32" 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) 240Hz Gaming Monitor\n\nMy goal with this build is to not have to worry about upgrading for awhile. 75% of the time I use my computer for very basic stuff (internet, editing travel videos and drone footage, microsoft office applications, etc...) The other 25% of the time would be for gaming. I\'m not a professional or anything, but I would like to play at, or close to, the highest settings, and if something new comes out in the next year or two, I don\'t want to worry if my system can handle it. (I\'m mostly into Fallout/Elder Scrolls/CIV type stuff, but co-workers want me to join them for some Fortnight/CoD)\n\n[![NightHawkRMX](https://tomshardware-data.community.forum/avatars/s/2458/2458595.jpg?1645973139)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/nighthawkrmx.2458595/)\n\n#### [NightHawkRMX](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/nighthawkrmx.2458595/)\n\n##### Titan\n\n**Ambassador**\n\nJan 1, 201818,5883,98581,540\n\n[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Ancient.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/ancient.35/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Elder.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/elder.33/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/CasingCooling_2-Authority.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/cooling-authority.159/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Laptops_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/laptop-tech-support-expert.123/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Prodigy.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/prodigy.21/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Veteran.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/veteran.32/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Motherboard_3-Master.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/motherboards-master.80/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Transcendent.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/transcendent.68/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Sentinel.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/sentinel.20/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Celebrated.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/celebrated.148/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Noble.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/noble.67/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/PreBuilt-Desktops_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/computer-brands-expert.126/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Guardian.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/guardian.19/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Journeyman.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/journeyman.31/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Windows_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/windows-10-expert.96/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Genius.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/genius.18/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/GraphicsCards_3-Master.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/graphics-card-master.89/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Motherboard_2-Authority.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/motherboards-authority.79/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Eminent.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/eminent.66/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/CPU-Overclock_3-Master.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/cpus-master.50/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Emeritus.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/emeritus.17/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/GraphicsCards_2-Authority.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/graphics-card-authority.88/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/CasingCooling_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/cooling-expert.158/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/ComputerBuilding_3-Master.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/systems-master.86/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Peripherals-Components_3-Master.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/components-master.53/)\n\nTo start, the 14900k is not recommended as the i9 14900k and 13900k have fairly well documented reliability issues that immediately should make you take them off of your shopping list, even though the issue is allegedly resolved at this point.

And this is totally on me, but I\'m not sure if I completely understand how to utilize this information for my build though, so let me know if I\'m on the right track here:\n\nRegarding the CPU... Right now, for my purposes, there isn\'t much advantage to the i9 over the i7. There might be in the long run, but only if the reliability issues have indeed been resolved. So I\'m basically rolling the dice? If I go with the i7, in two years I might need to upgrade. If I go with the i9 and there are issues, I might wish I went with the i7.\n\nAs for the GPU... Are you saying the 4080 Super is not all that powerful? Not that I necessarily need/want 4k capability right now, but the 4080 is pretty darn near the top of the line. Is the 4090 a big enough difference to justify the big jump in price for my build? Should I be waiting for the 50s? Or are you suggesting an AMD build?\n\nThanks again!\n\n[L](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/lafong.2901193/)\n\n#### [Lafong](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/lafong.2901193/)\n\n##### Dignified\n\nDec 2, 20216,0461,81715,690\n\n[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Veteran.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/veteran.32/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Renowned.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/renowned.65/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Journeyman.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/journeyman.31/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Platinum.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/platinum.45/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Laudable.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/laudable.64/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Gold.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/gold.44/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Initiate.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/initiate.30/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Palladium.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/palladium.43/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Famed.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/famed.63/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Mentor.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/mentor.14/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Windows_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/windows-10-expert.96/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/CasingCooling_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/cooling-expert.158/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Motherboard_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/motherboards-expert.78/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/ComputerBuilding_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/systems-expert.84/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Silver.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/silver.42/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Acolyte.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/acolyte.13/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Business%20Computing_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/storage-expert.90/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Adept.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/adept.12/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Honored.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/honored.62/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Titanium.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/titanium.41/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Respected.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/respected.61/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Steel.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/steel.40/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Neophyte.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/neophyte.11/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Bronze.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/bronze.39/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Remarkable.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/remarkable.60/)\n\nAt one time, I saw a list of Intel CPUs that might be affected by the well known reliability issue. I don\'t have the link.\n\nAs I recall, you can have "issues" with the i7 or i9. I think less so on the i5?\n\nOr not.\n\nTo that extent you are "rolling the dice". 1 chance in 7, 70, or 700? Not knowable with any accuracy. If you take the chance and it goes against you, would you shrug it off?\n\nMaybe the fix worked. Opinions differ. Pre-conceived notions prevail, as you might expect.\n\nIt\'s entirely possible the CPU will be the least of your worries.\n\nYour crystal ball will remain cloudy. It\'s tough for anyone but you to evaluate your own nervousness or how indifferent you might be to diminishing returns as you pay more money for minor performance advantages.....with the "reliability issue" hanging over your head.\n\n[D](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/dwd999.2027944/)\n\n#### [dwd999](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/dwd999.2027944/)\n\n##### Distinguished\n\nFeb

I will not recommand what you list there, here are some reasons\n\n1st of all, using 14900 or not is really depends on what game and what setting you are going to use.\n\nBasically, if you are going to do 4K gaming, which is very obviously expected, the requirements for CPU goes lower while the requirments of GPU is higher. Especially in some AAA tiles, here is an extreme case, you heard the game named Black Myth Wukong? If you try to go some extreme setting, like running it on 4K DLAA, everything setting to high meanwhile turn off the frame generation, then 24 FPS is what you got with 4090. Even if you turn on the dlss to 75, with frame generation on, you will get something about 60-70 FPS and there is hardly any difference between R7 5700x3d and R7 9800X3D, why? Because in this case it just requires too much GPU power, even the strongest gaming GPU can do that much, while a fairly slow CPU does not make any difference, after all, as long as the CPU is not way to old, it is powerful enough to work out 60-70 FPS.\n\nHowever, if you are going to play those game in 1080P, or play those games that do not require that much GPU power, then, there is a day and night difference between CPUs, that is why almost all those so called CPU TESTs are done based on 1080P and 4090 graphic, low setting. Why? Because in that case, when GPU go full throttle, it can go that fast that almost no cpu can handle that speed, how many FPS eventually you get is all depends on how fast is your CPU\'s gaming power(this is another part I want to mention later), this is why there are some conlsuion says that 14900 is much worse than 7800X3D. I can not say that is wrong, however, it must not applies to your case cuz you are doing 4K. Even the future 5090 is unlikely to maxed out 14900\'s gaming power in 4k AAA tiles, 8090, 9090, maybe.\n\n2\\. About gaming power, first of all, you should understand that since AMD R7 5800X3D, cpus\' total power is not 100% transfered to gaming power. If you talk about gaming power, 5800X3D is strong, so strong that you can not even believe why it has that much gaming power while the productivity power is so low that it is painful to look at. Same problem applies to R7 7800X3D and R7 9800X3D, they both have more gaming power than I9 14900K. However, Do you really need it now if you play with 4K?\n\n3\\. Despite the problem mentioned [@geofelt](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/107382/) above, I believe that at least for now, you should stay away from any Intel CPU and MB. It is not just because its gaming power/ power consumption ratio is bad but also LGA1700 platform is already come to the end of its life. The new platform is LGA1851, only last 2 years. Meawhile, AMD primised that AM5 will be there until 2027, which means that if you buy your CPU and MB from AMD, even until 2028, you will still able to update to the lastest AMD CPU and there is no cost, most importantly, no need to worry about reinstall Winodws. Image that, if you build you PC now, after 3-4 years, you replaced the CPU and graphic, everything is back to the top, no need to reinstall windows, tranfer the files. How good is that?\n\nThus, here is my suggestion on you current list\n\nCPU, try AMD 9700X, both 7800x3d and 9800x3d are expensive, not worth it, remeber, if you are doing 4K, at least for recent years, you don\'t need that much gaming power from CPU.\n\nMB: Go Asus X670E creator if you can, if there is no such stock, try Asus X670E HERO, if still no stock, try Asus X670E PRIME. Remeber, it must be X670E since X870E mb is a joke, that AMD force all the AIC to use its 2ed PCI-E 5.0x4 lane that directly wired to CPU to run USB4, which means in X870E, you need to down grade your PCI-E 16X to 8X so that you can have more than 1 PCI-E 5.0X4 that is directly wired to CPU to use. A joke isn\'t it? You may also have to do a no cpu bios flash in this case. It is not hard.\n\nSSD: I highly suggest you to not use PCI-E 5.0 NVME SSD. It is way too expensive and way too hot, so hot that you may have to use its customized heatsink to make it work properly. Like this is not bad enough, it can not help you with any gaming expirence at all, why? because its 4K reading performance, which is the most important thing for gaming. In fact, if you talk about gaming, there is little noticeble difference beteween PCI-E 3.0 NVME SSDs and PCI-E 5.0 NVME SSDs. So save your money go something like KC3000 2T, more compacity is better than the speed, if you can, go 4T. Meanwhile buy a chip SATA SSD, such as Samsung evo 500G for your OS only. This is because when you are gaming, your windows will always read files from your OS disk, for the best performance, it will be good if you have a psyical independent disk for your OS. Of course, you can only have 4 M.2 disks and as I mentioned above, if you go amd, then this system will go with you for long time, maybe until 2032 you can still gaming on it. Over the years, there must be a lot of data, and you have only 4 M.2, better you save some for future.\n\nPSU: At least 1000w+, better 1200w, trust me, it is totally worth it. Why? Because this thing is going to stay there for very long time. More power means more room for you to upgrade, god knows how much power RTX8090 is going to draw? Better a little bit more rather than buying PSU again. However, it does not means that you have to spend too much, basically, any ATX3.0/3.1 PSU will do since there since ATX3.0/3.1 standard creates a high barrier of entry, there is no bad ATX3.0/3.1 PSU.\n\nCase: I am not really sure where you are, however, if you can, I highly suggest you to use [this case](https://www.newegg.com/p/2AM-00GU-00128?&srsltid=AfmBOopXM-hF6IiJ5VXeWDSYdruLTKw70Q26N8G4b6XZYLjn9GGb29l_),. It is a Chinese brand named Great wall. In china that case only cost about 40% comparing with US nevertheless it is totally worth it. It may not looks that fancy however this case has its unique and unreplacble advantage. I was never a fan of vertical GPU intallation until recent years, why? All the grahic cards are getting bigger and bigger. Look at RTX4090, how big it is? You can hardly use any other pci-e slot because they are blocked. However, for this case there is a way out, if you check the case carefully you will found out that it has 3 vertical PCI-E slots on top of 7 horizntal slots. Sure, there are some other cases like this but all of them have a glass side pannel, which means that if you use those 3 vertical slots to install your GPU it is very likely to go overheat since there is not enough room between the side pannel and GPU for air flow but for this case there is no such problem because instead of a glass side pannel, it has a iron side pannel with so many thermal holes on it. Meanwhile, when you do a vertical GPU installation, make sure you buy a longer PCI-E 16X extension cable and make it go over the top of those horizntal slots so that you can use other PCI-E slots again as long as you don\'t use any PCI-E cards that is taller than a standard PCI-E slot\'s hight. This is still not the best part, the best part is, you don\'t need to do it as long as you have the case. You only do it when you need to do it. It is not payment in advance, it is something like a room for future upgrade.\n\nBesides, for this case, you can even do some creazy thing like [this](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/still-concerning-dual-aio-splitter-water-cooling-system-aio-gpu-aio-cpu.3845828/#post-23296560)\n\nThat is all, it was so long that I can not even believe myself\n\n- ![Like](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20viewBox%3D%220%200%2064%2064%22%3E%3Ctext%20x%3D%2250%25%22%20y%3D%2250%25%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20dominant-baseline%3D%22central%22%20font-size%3D%2254%22%3E%F0%9F%91%8D%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)\n\nReactions: [Roland Of Gilead](https://forums.tomshardware.com/posts/23376615/reactions)\n\n[![USAFRet](https://tomshardware-data.community.forum/avatars/s/1131/1131732.jpg?1547199327)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/usafret.1131732/)\n\n#### [USAFRet](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/usafret.1131732/)\n\n##### Titan\n\n**Moderator**\n\nMar 16, 2013177,44920,812184,590\n\n[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/AudioComponents_2-Authority.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/home-audio-authority.139/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Keyboards_3-Master.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/computer-peripherals-master.131/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Antivirus_3-Master.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/security-master.154/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/DigitalCamera-Video_3-Master.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/digital-camera-master.137/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/DigitalCamera-Video_2-Authority.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/digital-camera-authority.136/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/HomeTheater_2-Authority.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/home-theater-authority.133/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/HomeTheater_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/home-theater-expert.132/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Keyboards_2-Authority.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/computer-peripherals-authority.130/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Laptops_3-Master.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/laptop-tech-support-master.125/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Network%20Provider_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/network-provider-expert.117/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/MobileDevices-Gadgets_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/mobile-computing-expert.114/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Networking_3-Master.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/wireless-networking-master.113/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Networking_2-Authority.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/wireless-networking-authority.112/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/PC%20Games_3-Master.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/pc-gaming-master.104/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Open%20Source_2-Authority.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/open-source-authority.100/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Displays_3-Master.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/displays-master.95/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Displays_2-Authority.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/displays-authority.94/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Windows_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/windows-11-authority.162/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/PreBuilt-Desktops_2-Authority.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/computer-brands-authority.127/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Apps_3-Master.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/app-master.107/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Windows_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/windows-11-expert.161/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/GraphicsCards_3-Master.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/graphics-card-master.89/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Displays_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/displays-expert.93/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/AudioComponents_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/home-audio-expert.138/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Antivirus_2-Authority.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/security-authority.153/)\n\n> [FAhentai said:](https://forums.tomshardware.com/goto/post?id=23376615)\n>\n> but also LGA1700 platform is already come to the end of its life.

Especially in some AAA tiles, here is an extreme case, you heard the game named Black Myth Wukong? If you try to go some extreme setting, like running it on 4K DLAA, everything setting to high meanwhile turn off the frame generation, then 24 FPS is what you got with 4090. Even if you turn on the dlss to 75, with frame generation on, you will get something about 60-70 FPS and there is hardly any difference between R7 5700x3d and R7 9800X3D, why? Because in this case it just requires too much GPU power, even the strongest gaming GPU can do that much, while a fairly slow CPU does not make any difference, after all, as long as the CPU is not way to old, it is powerful enough to work out 60-70 FPS.\n>\n> However, if you are going to play those game in 1080P, or play those games that do not require that much GPU power, then, there is a day and night difference between CPUs, that is why almost all those so called CPU TESTs are done based on 1080P and 4090 graphic, low setting. Why? Because in that case, when GPU go full throttle, it can go that fast that almost no cpu can handle that speed, how many FPS eventually you get is all depends on how fast is your CPU\'s gaming power(this is another part I want to mention later), this is why there are some conlsuion says that 14900 is much worse than 7800X3D. I can not say that is wrong, however, it must not applies to your case cuz you are doing 4K. Even the future 5090 is unlikely to maxed out 14900\'s gaming power in 4k AAA tiles, 8090, 9090, maybe.\n>\n> 2\\. About gaming power, first of all, you should understand that since AMD R7 5800X3D, cpus\' total power is not 100% transfered to gaming power. If you talk about gaming power, 5800X3D is strong, so strong that you can not even believe why it has that much gaming power while the productivity power is so low that it is painful to look at. Same problem applies to R7 7800X3D and R7 9800X3D, they both have more gaming power than I9 14900K. However, Do you really need it now if you play with 4K?\n>\n> 3\\. Despite the problem mentioned [@geofelt](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/107382/) above, I believe that at least for now, you should stay away from any Intel CPU and MB. It is not just because its gaming power/ power consumption ratio is bad but also LGA1700 platform is already come to the end of its life. The new platform is LGA1851, only last 2 years. Meawhile, AMD primised that AM5 will be there until 2027, which means that if you buy your CPU and MB from AMD, even until 2028, you will still able to update to the lastest AMD CPU and there is no cost, most importantly, no need to worry about reinstall Winodws. Image that, if you build you PC now, after 3-4 years, you replaced the CPU and graphic, everything is back to the top, no need to reinstall windows, tranfer the files. How good is that?\n>\n> Thus, here is my suggestion on you current list\n>\n> CPU, try AMD 9700X, both 7800x3d and 9800x3d are expensive, not worth it, remeber, if you are doing 4K, at least for recent years, you don\'t need that much gaming power from CPU.\n>\n> MB: Go Asus X670E creator if you can, if there is no such stock, try Asus X670E HERO, if still no stock, try Asus X670E PRIME. Remeber, it must be X670E since X870E mb is a joke, that AMD force all the AIC to use its 2ed PCI-E 5.0x4 lane that directly wired to CPU to run USB4, which means in X870E, you need to down grade your PCI-E 16X to 8X so that you can have more than 1 PCI-E 5.0X4 that is directly wired to CPU to use. A joke isn\'t it? You may also have to do a no cpu bios flash in this case. It is not hard.\n>\n> SSD: I highly suggest you to not use PCI-E 5.0 NVME SSD. It is way too expensive and way too hot, so hot that you may have to use its customized heatsink to make it work properly. Like this is not bad enough, it can not help you with any gaming expirence at all, why? because its 4K reading performance, which is the most important thing for gaming. In fact, if you talk about gaming, there is little noticeble difference beteween PCI-E 3.0 NVME SSDs and PCI-E 5.0 NVME SSDs. So save your money go something like KC3000 2T, more compacity is better than the speed, if you can, go 4T. Meanwhile buy a chip SATA SSD, such as Samsung evo 500G for your OS only. This is because when you are gaming, your windows will always read files from your OS disk, for the best performance, it will be good if you have a psyical independent disk for your OS. Of course, you can only have 4 M.2 disks and as I mentioned above, if you go amd, then this system will go with you for long time, maybe until 2032 you can still gaming on it. Over the years, there must be a lot of data, and you have only 4 M.2, better you save some for future.\n>\n> PSU: At least 1000w+, better 1200w, trust me, it is totally worth it. Why? Because this thing is going to stay there for very long time. More power means more room for you to upgrade, god knows how much power RTX8090 is going to draw? Better a little bit more rather than buying PSU again. However, it does not means that you have to spend too much, basically, any ATX3.0/3.1 PSU will do since there since ATX3.0/3.1 standard creates a high barrier of entry, there is no bad ATX3.0/3.1 PSU.\n>\n> Case: I am not really sure where you are, however, if you can, I highly suggest you to use [this case](https://www.newegg.com/p/2AM-00GU-00128?&srsltid=AfmBOopXM-hF6IiJ5VXeWDSYdruLTKw70Q26N8G4b6XZYLjn9GGb29l_),. It is a Chinese brand named Great wall. In china that case only cost about 40% comparing with US nevertheless it is totally worth it. It may not looks that fancy however this case has its unique and unreplacble advantage. I was never a fan of vertical GPU intallation until recent years, why? All the grahic cards are getting bigger and bigger. Look at RTX4090, how big it is? You can hardly use any other pci-e slot because they are blocked. However, for this case there is a way out, if you check the case carefully you will found out that it has 3 vertical PCI-E slots on top of 7 horizntal slots. Sure, there are some other cases like this but all of them have a glass side pannel, which means that if you use those 3 vertical slots to install your GPU it is very likely to go overheat since there is not enough room between the side pannel and GPU for air flow but for this case there is no such problem because instead of a glass side pannel, it has a iron side pannel with so many thermal holes on it. Meanwhile, when you do a vertical GPU installation, make sure you buy a longer PCI-E 16X extension cable and make it go over the top of those horizntal slots so that you can use other PCI-E slots again as long as you don\'t use any PCI-E cards that is taller than a standard PCI-E slot\'s hight. This is still not the best part, the best part is, you don\'t need to do it as long as you have the case. You only do it when you need to do it. It is not payment in advance, it is something like a room for future upgrade.\n>\n> Besides, for this case, you can even do some creazy thing like [this](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/still-concerning-dual-aio-splitter-water-cooling-system-aio-gpu-aio-cpu.3845828/#post-23296560)\n>\n> That is all, it was so long that I can not even believe myself\n>\n>\n> Click to expand...\n\nMy brain hurts reading this 😉 But some good points ![:)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/assets/smilies/smile.gif)\n\n- ![Like](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20viewBox%3D%220%200%2064%2064%22%3E%3Ctext%20x%3D%2250%25%22%20y%3D%2250%25%22%20text-anchor%3D%22middle%22%20dominant-baseline%3D%22central%22%20font-size%3D%2254%22%3E%F0%9F%91%8D%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)\n\nReactions: [Zerk2012](https://forums.tomshardware.com/posts/23376644/reactions)\n\n[![FAhentai](https://tomshardware-data.community.forum/avatars/s/2111/2111492.jpg?1699035286)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/fahentai.2111492/)\n\n#### [FAhentai](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/fahentai.2111492/)\n\n##### Distinguished\n\nJul 3, 2016991318,545\n\n[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Reader.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/reader.10/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Brass.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/brass.37/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Liked.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/liked.58/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Ancient.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/ancient.35/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Elder.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/elder.33/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Veteran.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/veteran.32/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Novice.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/novice.36/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Journeyman.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/journeyman.31/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Initiate.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/initiate.30/)\n\n> [USAFRet said:](https://forums.tomshardware.com/goto/post?id=23376630)\n>\n> For some people, like myself, that is not really a consideration.\n>\n> I don\'t upgrade just the CPU.

The higher you go with any hardware the less value you get for your money. Also for gaming, the GPU generally contributes more to overall game performance than the CPU for the same amount of money.\n\nThe increase in performance you get from high-end hardware is laughable, to be honest. For example an rtx 2080-ti will get you an average of +33% more performance in games compared to a rtx 2060s at triple the price.

Now consider that GPU contributes more to your overall gaming experience and you can see that for CPUs this gets even worse. For example a 10900k will on average perform about 5% better than a 10600k at double the price.\n\nFor gaming, you should generally aim for i3/r3 for entry-level, i5/r5 for your average gaming rig, and i7/r7 for high-end gaming. An r9 is generally more of a consumer workstation CPU and an i9 is just a slightly better i7 which is also better suited for workstation tasks than for gaming (for its price). Generally speaking, an i5/r5 is the best value, while the i7/r7 are the best reasonably priced performance.\n\nHowever if you had to choose between an i5/r5, i7/r7 and i9/r9 and the saved money would go into your GPU budget, than the i5/r5 are probably the best pick. Also as a general tip, don\'t worry about bottlenecking your GPU. Any recent i3/r3+ can run all consumer GPUs just fine.\n\nUpvote ·\n96\n\n95\n\nPromoted by Asana\n\n[![Profile photo for Asana, Inc.](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-2085029710-50-wurivyxpwkxytspvzevhpngdkgzqarvn.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Asana-Inc)\n\n[Asana, Inc.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Asana-Inc)\n\nTrack, manage, and connect your projects across any team\n\n·\xa0[Jan 6](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-project-management-tools-for-managers/answer/Asana-Inc)\n\nWhat are the best project management tools for managers?\n\nIf you’re managing a team or program, you might have multiple projects in progress at the same time.

In gaming, the graphics card (GPU) often has a more significant impact on performance than the CPU.\n2. Other Tasks:If you also engage in tasks that benefit from a powerful CPU, such as content creation, video editing, 3D rendering, or streaming, the i9-12900K\'s high core count and performance may be more justified.\n3. Budget:High-end processors often come with a higher price tag. If you are on a tight budget and your primary use is gaming, you might consider allocating more of your budget to a high-performance graphics card rather than an extremely powerful CPU.\n4. Future-Proofing:If you\'re looking for a system that will remain relevant and performant for several years, investing in a high-end CPU might provide a level of future-proofing. However, keep in mind that gaming performance improvements often come from advancements in graphics technology.\n5. Alternative CPUs:Depending on your needs, you might also consider other CPUs in Intel\'s or AMD\'s lineup that offer excellent gaming performance at a potentially more cost-effective price point.\n\nUltimately, the decision on whether the i9-12900K is overkill for gaming depends on your specific use case, preferences, and budget. It\'s always a good idea to consider the overall balance of your system, ensuring that both the CPU and GPU are well-matched to provide optimal performance for your intended tasks.

Looking at your work for the second, third, or fourth time around may inspire you to spice up your language with longer, more uncommon words. There’s nothing wrong with having a thesaurus nearby, but try to limit the repetition of long, pretentious-feeling words so your work flows well and doesn’t feel too bogged down. At the end of the day, you want it to feel true to you and the message you’re conveying.\n3. Remember who the reader is. Don’t forget your own voice as the writer—but don’t forget who your reader is. Many writers get too close to their work; editing is a chance to try to get out of your own head. Who is your ideal reader? What do you want them to take away from the writing? It’s a unique time to step in their shoes, to make sure your communication is as effective as you’d like it to be.\n4. Kill your darlings. Don’t be scared to remove chunks of your work, even if it feels precious to you. If it’s a passage that’s really tough to part with, try saving it somewhere else, so you can return to it later in your piece or for another work.\n5. Use Grammarly. Last but not least, [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/a?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=promotedanswers&utm_content=effectivelyeditwriting&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106235110191%7C0 "www.grammarly.com") has countless resources for editing your work.

I decided to add $500 every month. At the time, it felt like a stretch—I had bills to pay and other priorities—but I stuck with it.\n\nToday, that account has grown to over $140,000. In another 10 years, it should be worth around $350,000. That single decision gave me the financial freedom I never thought I’d have. Today, I tell my friends to do the same. You can go to a site like [SavingsPro](https://savingspro.org/the-best-ways-for-to-invest/?s1=Q_A_Choice_DT_C&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106241805163%7C0 "savingspro.org") and select one of the investment platforms that’s offering a bonus for opening an account.\n\nNext, I tackled my car insurance.\n\nI’d been overpaying for years because I thought loyalty to my insurer would save me money—it didn’t. One afternoon, I spent 10 minutes on [Coverage.com](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_A_Choice_DT_C&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106241805163%7C0 "www.myfinance.com") comparing offers and ended up saving $1100 a year by switching. That extra money went straight into my investments. If you haven’t shopped your policy around on [a comparison site like this](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_A_Choice_DT_C&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106241805163%7C0 "www.myfinance.com"), you’re probably overpaying too.\n\nDebt relief was another game-changer.\n\nLike many people, at one point I had built up a little credit card debt—$15,000, to be exact. I felt stuck, paying minimums and barely chipping away at the balance. Then I found [this debt relief program](https://www.bankrate.com/landing/savingspro/best-debt-relief-options/?s1=Q_A_Choice_DT_C&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106241805163%7C0 "www.bankrate.com") that reduced what I owed and within two years, I was debt-free.

Then I [switched to a high-interest account](https://savingspro.org/savings-rates/?s1=Q_A_Choice_DT_C&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106241805163%7C0 "savingspro.org") offering over 4.00%. Watching my savings grow without lifting a finger was incredibly rewarding. [Here’s a list](https://savingspro.org/savings-rates/?s1=Q_A_Choice_DT_C&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106241805163%7C0 "savingspro.org") of the best accounts to help you get started.\n\nFinally, I fixed my credit.\n\nBad credit can hold you back in ways you don’t even realize—from higher insurance premiums to difficulty renting apartments. I used one of the [options listed on Bankrate to fix it](https://www.bankrate.com/landing/savingspro/credit-repair/?s1=Q_A_Choice_DT_C&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106241805163%7C0 "www.bankrate.com"). Within a year, my credit score improved by 220 points.\n\nThese decisions weren’t massive or life-altering in the moment, but looking back, they completely changed my life.

Because of Ryzen.\n\nAll Ryzen CPUs above Ryzen 3s are hyperthreaded and all of them are capable of overclocking. They also come with great stock coolers (which the K-series Intel chips don’t even have). Many AAA titles are starting to use 12 threads or more (such as Battlefield 1), so if you game on an i5–8600K for instance, it will become stuttery in demanding multiplayer lobbies because of the lack of threads, whereas on a Ryzen 5 2600X, it may not get the highest maximum fps, but it will be a lot smoother.\n\nHowever, the K range of Intel chips (8700K, 8600K and 8350K) do make sense if the games you play need high single core performance. Simulator games such as Flight Simulator X and OMSI 2 need high single core performance more than they need a fancy GPU, so for those situations, get Intel.\n\nOtherwise, get AMD.\n\nUpvote ·\n9943\n\n92\n\n95\n\n[![Profile photo for Brett Bergan](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-233327541-50-ryuueepityybhwbzcduicutierxjiwht.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brett-Bergan)\n\n[Brett Bergan](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brett-Bergan)\n\nBuilding PC\'s for 25 years · Author has 8.5K answers and 148.8M answer views\n\n·\xa0[3y](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-i9-10900K-regarded-as-the-best-gaming-processor-what-happened-to-the-i9-11900K-and-the-i9-12900K/answer/Brett-Bergan)\n\nRelated\n\nWhy is the i9-10900K regarded as the best gaming processor, what happened to the i9-11900K and the i9-12900K?\n\nThe 12900K blows the 10900K out of the water.\n\nThat being said, the 10900K does have ten actual high-performance cores while the 12900K still only has eight.\n\nIf the 10900K were considered to be “better” than the 12900K it would be so in the respect that the 12900K can crash in some games that do not effectively distinguish between E-cores and P-cores.

IRL, however, the 11900K manages to only fall behind the 10900K by about 5%, and does much better in many optimized productivity tasks due to new-gen features.\n\nThe massive improvements I see with 12th gen gaming is in the 1% lows. With the extra cores, the CPU can keep doing what CPU’s do without having to get sidetracked and allowing frame rates to dip. This is a major factor I have seen in the transition from the six-core i5 (8600K 9600K) to the hyperthreaded six-core (10600K) namely the CPU performs extremely well al the time instead of experiencing frame-time spikes. The 12600K blows them all out of the water with its ability to do system tasks on the E-cores while letting its six core/twelve thread P-Core complex give 100% attention to gaming.\n\nThis comparison shows the steady improvement from one gen to the next witht huge leap in performance going from single-thread to hyperthreading in the 10600K\n\n![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4a9f1c4ee48655e1fe096c17ab4dbfb2-pjlq)\n\n> F1 and Cyberpunk both showed this oddity with HT cores beating the ST core at 1080, but being the same at 1440—only showing improvements in the 1% lows.\n\nMost games thus are mostly not limited by CPU performance, and it is not uncommon for a 10600K to match (or on rare occasions beat) the 12900K. One game benchmark (AC:Valhalla) saw the 9600K beating out the rest of the field.\n\n![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8df33bfab1a7a7298e2d3ac84041306d-pjlq)\n\n> Go Figure. Valhalla is obviously extremely GPU bound as is Control, which saw exactly zero difference regardless of the CPU used.\n\nProbably less than half the games tested followed the expected stair-step progression in frame rate performance shown here by Watch Dogs Legion.\n\n![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cb6edfff8b7bedef5e94908242291c9a-pjlq)\n\nIf your game of choice is Watch Dogs Legion and you have or plan to get a RTX 3080 and play at 1080p, then yes, you probably should spend the extra hundred or two for a 12600K or a 12700K. But once you move to 1440p or use a slower graphics card, it becomes harder to justify spending a lot more on a CPU.\n\nKeep in mind as well that you have other options. The i5–11400 with unlocked power limits can come within spitting distance of a 11600K, and is selling fro a very reasonable $189—compared to $165 for the i5–10400. The 10400 is BETTER (faster and more efficient) than the 11400 at stock speeds. But once the limits are off, the 11400 can pull well ahead, as I said, very close to the 11600K.\n\nYou have options. Unfortunately some super secret performance trick always ends up on a big youtube channel and pretty soon you have eleven million people all clamoring for the same oddball CPU and the price goes sky high while inventory is ransacked. This is what happened to the Ryzen 3 3300X. It really is no better than an i3–10100, but the hype-train made you believe that this miracle CPU was the actual second coming of Jesus himself.\n\nUpvote ·\n999209\n\n9922\n\n95\n\n[![Profile photo for Diistriict](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-338794684-50-vucnreqduiqnqmanmxtgnfzcqxcnrnme.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Diistriict)\n\n[Diistriict](https://www.quora.com/profile/Diistriict)\n\nStudied Master of Commerce at University of Delhi (Graduated 2020) · Author has 244 answers and 172.1K answer views\n\n·\xa0[3y](https://www.quora.com/Is-Ryzen-9-overkill-for-gaming/answer/Diistriict)\n\nRelated\n\nIs Ryzen 9 overkill for gaming?\n\nDon’t forget to follow me on Instagram, insta id \\[ diistriict \\]\n\nYes, the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is an excellent choice for gaming, if a bit pricey.

Its 12 cores might be a little overkill for gaming, but its raw processing speed puts it at the top against any and all competition.\n\nThe biggest reason the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is good for gaming is one thing: It\'s incredibly fast. A lot of computer processors are fast, but the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is the kind of fast that\'s made to make your games run well. A lot of it comes down to the way the processor is built. Unlike its Intel competition, the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X tightens the design so that each of its 12 cores has an easier time accessing information. Because of that, your games will run smoother, especially if they\'re not particularly core-hungry. There\'s a reason AMD\'s processors are incredibly popular even in laptops.\n\nThis is notable, because the processor itself has a lot more cores than you really need for most games. For most people, 12 cores is pointless for gaming, but it\'s how they\'re designed that matters when it comes to how quickly your graphics card can render out frames of your beautiful game on your monitor. This gets even more important if you\'re someone who plays on a 1440p or 4K monitor at frame rates above 60 per second.\n\nWithout wading into the swamp of technical details about the complex ways processors interact with your RAM and GPU to run your games, all you need to know is that the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X makes particular design choices that increase the overall speeds compared to previous intretions. Specifically, it\'s the way each core is physically closer to each other and the L3 cache, providing more efficient ways to grab information. This leads to the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X having a faster IPC, or instructions per clock than its clock speed might imply.\n\nIt\'s the main reason the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is good for gaming, and frankly, a lot of other intensive operations. Without this specific design choice, the cores would take longer to render a game and those delays could add up to a noticeable lack in performance. The AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is unique because it\'s built to fuel your PC when it\'s trying to run a demanding game.\n\nHere\'s the biggest catch about the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X when it comes to gaming and, well, everything. It\'s incredibly hard to get still. In part because of the state of the world and because a ton of people really wanted to build powerful PCs lately, the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is a really, really tough chip to get. It\'s also expensive, coming in at $50 MSRP (a price you won\'t see a ton still because of the intense demand) over the last generation\'s high-end option.\n\nThat puts it at $549 which is pretty steep, especially when the gains aren\'t huge if you already have a previous Ryzen CPU. At the same time though, if you want to future-proof yourself, it\'s close to competitive pricing for anything close to its power out there.\n\nThank’you :)\n\nUpvote ·\n\n[![Profile photo for Tom Battraw](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-263463919-50-pcocnkvwaznmbhtouykicpbnkniywctt.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tom-Battraw)\n\n[Tom Battraw](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tom-Battraw)\n\nI research all the cool gizmos I can\'t afford · Author has 505 answers and 2.4M answer views\n\n·\xa0[5y](https://www.quora.com/Are-i9-processors-good-for-gaming/answer/Tom-Battraw?no_redirect=1)\n\nRelated\n\nAre i9 processors good for gaming?\n\nThis entirely depends on the type of i9 in question.\n\nDesktop, non-HEDT i9s such as the i9–9900K are remarkably good for gaming: they have blisteringly fast single-core and quad core speeds, which are the most important for gaming.

They tend to be much more expensive than i7s, but if the laptop doesn’t have a very good cooling solution, the performance will be nearly identical. The latest 16″ MacBook Pro usually can only eke out single-digit FPS improvements when upgrading to the more expensive i9 and GPU, largely due to thermal issues.\n\nIn the end, i7s and i9s tend to be very similar for gaming. Unless you also edit videos or do other CPU-intensive work on the side, or just have piles of money sitting around waiting to be spent, you should probably stick with an i7 and call it good.\n\nUpvote ·\n9916\n\n[![Profile photo for Francis](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-73059017-50-rushtfyqismtuutsgmctxjljwkafowvk.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Francis-765)\n\n[Francis](https://www.quora.com/profile/Francis-765)\n\nAnalyst at National Health Service (NHS) (2008–present) · Author has 10.2K answers and 59.5M answer views\n\n·\xa0[4y](https://www.quora.com/Is-a-Core-i9-processor-overkill-for-most-users/answer/Francis-765)\n\nRelated\n\nIs a Core i9 processor overkill for most users?\n\nI seldom answer questions using memes.

Note that high resolutions bottleneck the video card, not the CPU. The higher the frame rate, the harder the CPU has to work to provide the data to the video card. That’s why high resolutions and/or high settings, which pull down the frame rate towards 60fps, don’t tend to bottleneck due to the CPU. Lower resolutions ( e.g. trying to reach 120fps for a 120hz monitor) require the CPU to work harder.\n\nUnder some scenarios, at lower resolutions, when trying to reach high frame rates, you might bottleneck some video cards with the i5. And in some cases, perhaps having more cores could help. That’s a lot of “perhaps” for spending a few hundred more for the i7 and i9, but I don’t think it’s a foolish waste of money. Just a bit fiscally unsound for a gaming only rig, where the 6 cores of the i5 seem sufficient.\n\nNote that your single threaded performance is roughly the same for the i5, i7 and i9 processors, depending on your overclock ( if getting a K processor.)

As of my last update in September 2021, Intel\'s Core i9 processors were among the highest-performing consumer-grade CPUs, typically targeted at gamers, content creators, and professionals who demand top-tier performance.\n\nTo understand why i9 processors are suitable for gaming, let\'s explore some key aspects:\n\n1. High Core Count and Clock Speeds: Most Intel Core i9 processors feature a high core count, often ranging from 8 to 18 cores, with Hyper-Threading enabled. Hyper-Threading allows each physical core to handle two threads, effectively doubling the number of threads. The high core count and Hyper-Threading capability enable i9 processors to handle multi-threaded workloads efficiently, which is beneficial for certain gaming scenarios and multi-tasking.\n\nMoreover, i9 processors typically have high clock speeds, especially when using Intel\'s Turbo Boost technology. Turbo Boost allows the processor to dynamically increase its clock speed when required, providing an extra performance boost for demanding tasks like gaming.\n\n1. Single-Core Performance: Gaming performance is significantly influenced by single-core performance, as most games are not optimized to utilize a large number of cores and threads efficiently. In this regard, i9 processors shine with their strong single-core performance, enabling smooth gameplay and high frame rates in single-threaded game titles.\n2. Overclocking Potential: Many Intel Core i9 processors, especially the "K" and "KF" models, are unlocked, allowing users to overclock them. Overclocking involves increasing the clock speed of the processor beyond its stock settings. When done correctly and with appropriate cooling, overclocking can boost gaming performance even further, providing an edge in certain CPU-intensive games.\n3. Integrated Graphics: Most Intel Core i9 processors for desktops do not come with integrated graphics since they are intended for use with dedicated graphics cards. However, some i9 processors designed for laptops (H-series) do come with integrated graphics, offering power-saving features and enabling basic gaming without a dedicated GPU.\n4. Pairing with High-End Graphics Cards: For optimal gaming performance, pairing an i9 processor with a high-end graphics card is crucial. The GPU plays a more significant role in gaming performance than the CPU, especially at higher resolutions and graphical settings. High-end graphics cards, such as NVIDIA\'s RTX 30 series or AMD\'s Radeon RX 6000 series, can deliver excellent gaming experiences when combined with an i9 processor.\n5. Memory and Storage: The performance of gaming systems is also influenced by the amount and speed of RAM (memory) and storage options. Having sufficient and fast RAM, such as DDR4 or DDR5, ensures smooth loading times and minimizes in-game stutters. Additionally, using a fast storage solution, like NVMe SSDs, can further enhance loading times and system responsiveness.\n6. Cooling and Thermal Management: Due to their high performance, i9 processors can generate significant heat under heavy workloads, such as gaming. It is essential to pair the i9 processor with an efficient cooling solution to maintain optimal performance and prevent thermal throttling, where the CPU reduces its clock speed to prevent overheating. Aftermarket cooling solutions like high-end air coolers or liquid cooling can help keep temperatures in check during extended gaming sessions.\n7. Future-Proofing: Investing in an i9 processor can provide a level of future-proofing for your gaming system. While gaming performance primarily relies on the GPU, having a powerful CPU can help ensure that the system remains relevant for more demanding games and applications in the years to come.\n\nIn summary, Intel Core i9 processors are indeed well-suited for gaming due to their high core counts, strong single-core performance, overclocking potential, and overall high-performance capabilities. Paired with a high-end graphics card, fast RAM, and a capable cooling solution, an i9 processor can deliver a premium gaming experience with smooth frame rates, improved graphical fidelity, and reduced loading times.\n\nHowever, it\'s essential to consider your specific needs and budget when choosing a processor for gaming. While i9 processors offer top-tier performance, they come at a premium price compared to other CPU options like Intel Core i7 processors or AMD\'s Ryzen series, which also provide excellent gaming performance at more affordable price points.\n\nAs technology advances, new processors and graphics cards are continuously released, offering improved performance and features. It\'s crucial to stay informed about the latest hardware releases, read reviews, and consider real-world benchmarks to make an informed decision that aligns with your gaming needs and budget.\n\nUpvote ·\n\n[![Profile photo for Brett Bergan](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-233327541-50-ryuueepityybhwbzcduicutierxjiwht.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brett-Bergan)\n\n[Brett Bergan](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brett-Bergan)\n\nBuilding PC\'s for 25 years · Author has 8.5K answers and 148.8M answer views\n\n·\xa0[4y](https://www.quora.com/How-strong-is-an-i9-9900KS-in-gaming-performance/answer/Brett-Bergan)\n\nRelated\n\nHow strong is an i9-9900KS in gaming performance?\n\nThe problem with these insane gaming CPU’s is that there is nothing short of a RTX Titan in SLI running at 1080p that can really max it out unless you are shooting for 750fps in CS:GO.\n\nThe 9900KS and the 10900K are about equal when being tested with a RTX 2080 Ti, but that is probably because the GPU is just too weak to show the difference between the two.\n\n![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c172605b2e18af3450c5bedd290851f3-lq)\n\nThese are very typical results with averages and lows within 1–2fps.

You don’t need anything better; just put the G3258 on a motherboard that allows for overclocking, and clock the chip as high as it will go.\n\nHowever, the latest titles do need more than one or two threads. Part of that is because a lot of PC games are ported from the consoles, and the current generation of consoles, the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One, actually use an eight-core x86 CPU sourced from AMD. Because this CPU doesn’t have great single-core performance, but does have many threads (six of the eight are available for game programming), new titles on the consoles are written to spread work across multiple simultaneous threads as much as possible. As the games get ported to PC, it remains important to have multiple threads available. Some new titles won’t even run on a dual-core with no HT without being hacked, and then they run choppy.\n\nFor this reason, I don’t recommend the G3258 anymore for budget gaming rigs, instead pointing people in the direction of AMD’s Athlon 860/870/880K series of quad-core chips if on a tight budget, or the Intel i5–6600K for higher-end setups that can run higher resolutions and eye-candy settings. All of these are true quad-core chips that are capable of processing four simultaneous threads.\n\nUpvote ·\n92\n\n[![Profile photo for Drazen Zoric](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-1127541353-50-kijcbkutfpvmpnjfazckwhagiqukwnfm.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Drazen-Zoric)\n\n[Drazen Zoric](https://www.quora.com/profile/Drazen-Zoric)\n\nLives in Cork, Ireland · Author has 7.6K answers and 19M answer views\n\n·\xa0[3y](https://www.quora.com/How-does-Intel-claim-the-Core-i9-12900K-is-the-worlds-best-gaming-processor/answer/Drazen-Zoric)\n\nRelated\n\nHow does Intel claim the Core i9 12900K is the world\'s best gaming processor?\n\nWell do you remember what Apple said when released M1 and recently M1 Max?\n\nWhat happened after few weeks when people tested them?\n\nSame for Intel.

I\'ve compiled a few links below talking about different aspects of this issue.\n\nThe overall issue manifests as spontaneous rebooting, blue screens, or apps that crash to desktop at random intervals; and particularly hard hit seem to be software that does decompression - whether it\'s a game doing texture "stuff", or 7-zip or those types of applications. Intel has released updated power / voltage recommendations for motherboard vendors, but that doesn\'t appear to have addressed the issue.\n\nIntel is also reported to be fielding a very high level of RMA for these processors; and it\'s specifically the i9 (highest clocked, highest core count) processors. The 12th gen does not appear to be affected, and the 13th and 14th gen i7s only seem to be mildly affected (not nearly as clearly as the i9). In 13th and 14th gen, the i7 is lower clocked and has 8 performance + 8 efficient cores, while the i9s are 8+16.\n\nInformational/source links are below. I\'ve summarized take-aways for each link:\n\nGame Developer(s) indicating that >80% of all reported crashes in their games occur on these specific processors:\n\n![www.theregister.com](https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/01/12/chip_shutterstock.jpg)\n\n### [Intel accused of selling ‘defective’ Raptor Lake CPUs](https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/13/game_raptor_intel/)\n\nHigh-end processor instability headaches, failures pushed one studio to switch to AMD\n\n![www.theregister.com](https://www.theregister.com/design_picker/13249a2e80709c7ff2e57dd3d49801cd534f2094/graphics/favicons/favicon.ico)\nwww.theregister.com\n\n\n![alderongames.com](https://alderongames.com/images/og/og-default-pot.png)\n\n### [Intel is selling defective CPUs - Alderon Games](https://alderongames.com/intel-crashes)\n\nWe have been encountering significant problems with Intel CPU stability.

Game Servers love single threaded performance which is why they\'ve been using Core i9. Worth noting is they tend to use "W" / workstation chipsets, that will not expose these processors to very high power limit levels like consumer boards. He also cited warranty costs going up 8x for servers based on Core i9 vs. a few months ago. L1T dove into a lot of publicly available logging information to verify high failure rates.\n\nIntel has a Pretty Big Problem - YouTube\n\nLevel1Techs\n\n475K subscribers\n\n[Intel has a Pretty Big Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzHcrbT5D_Y)\n\nLevel1Techs\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn\'t begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou\'re signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV\'s watch history and influence TV recommendations.

However current evidence makes it look doubtful that process is a root cause (although maybe there is a contributing factor). The FPGAs, ADL, EMR, SPR, and non i9 RPLs don’t seem to have issues. The problems seem to also be frequency and wattage independent. If there was an excursion it would be across more product skus and a lower percentage of parts. If the power was pushed too far you would not see issues at low power. If there is some wonky process marginality it would likely show up in more places such EMR or even be far more prevalent with the i7s since they share the same die.

Sometimes it\'s an e-core(cluster) or a p-core that can be removed to bring back stability to the CPU.\n\nJust a comment on voltages - while the consumer boards definitely overvolted a bit too much when hitting 5.8, 6.0, and 6.2 GHz on 1-2 cores.. The i9s (13900K, 14900K, 14900KS respectively) require something on the order of 1.5V out of the box.\n\nThe main difference between the server boards and consumer is the total amperage draw is more limited, effectively reducing local heat spots. The actual voltage limits of the server boards could be +/- consumer boards; less because no OC profiles are needed, but equal or more if they want to ensure stability at ~ 6 GHz \\* 1-2 core workloads. Even muddier is servers could actually run hotter than consumer PCs because of density requirements offsetting lower maximum power draw.\n\n..\n\nIf the problem is temperature - servers and consumer will probably fail about the same rate. If it\'s about core counts - i9 will fail first. If it\'s about total power draw (local hotspots) - consumers should fail more than servers. If it\'s about voltage or frequency - then consumers and servers should fail about the same rate.\n\n[N](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php?members/nghanayem.170880/)\n\n#### [nghanayem](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php?members/nghanayem.170880/)\n\n##### Well-known member\n\n> [lefty said:](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php?goto/post&id=72051)\n>\n> They are run on the same node as Alder lake.

Presumably mobile is all RPL since the power consumption dropped so much for all skus going from 12-13th gen. I also wouldn\'t be shocked if over time more of the 13th gen and maybe all of the 14th gen mainstream CPUs were all RPL si to give it that little extra. It is also worth noting that depending on what changed process side, the CPUs can be on the new process with no stepping change and all that would be missing is the small RPL design enhancements (which might be the RC for the small perf and power deltas between different 13400Fs). Given the strict reliability requirements and higher operating temps you would think that EMR qual would have found any issues with changes made going from intel 7 to intel 7+ if they existed.\n\n[I](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php?members/iancutress.332971/)\n\n#### [IanCutress](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php?members/iancutress.332971/)\n\n##### Member\n\nWendell and I spoke about this in our latest podcast.

Wendell and I discussed privately about electromigration and degradation, but I\'m starting to wonder if it\'s more physical than that.\n\n2\\. The socket latch has long been a point of concern for thermals. Lots of pins, not a lot of uniform pressure. If ground pins aren\'t connecting, that increases issues even if the CPU still works due to resistance/impedance.\n\n3\\. Not only that, but the physical warpage of the CPU over time. We were seeing overclockers having issues with the default socket latch on day one, causing motherboards and CPUs to bend.\n\n4\\. If the silicon inside is feeling torque due to anticlastic deformation via the socket, that could cause non-regular issues long-term that are hard to pin down in software. A symptom of that could be increased electromigration, making the chip design not the cause, but the socket.\n\n5\\. This means that the silicon in the chip could be experiencing deformation at a fundamental level. Power and data connections, if brittle enough, could increase resistance due to deformation. Normally this isn\'t an issue in regular use, but neither is it tested for in validation.\n\n6\\. I should stress I have no data to back this up, aside from the seemingly unfocused nature of the errors affecting all systems, inc non-K and T, and even in underclocked environments focused on stability. The fact it\'s more of a thing now is a factor of time.\n\n7\\. We\'re seeing more high-end CPUs because of the fact that those units typically need more mounting pressure, or might use boards without a mounting plate. The cooling requirements are higher, the current draw is higher, so any shear twist or torque will exacerbate over time.\n\n8\\. This is one of the many reasons why we love sockets that apply equal pressure.\n\nSimply put, if electromigration is happening, it\'s a symptom rather than a cause. It\'s on the low end SKUs as well, even stable ones.\n\nWhy not Alder (12th Gen) over Raptor?

I think the Intel challenge is going to be how to react and the PR to the reaction.\n\nIn reality, Intel could ignore the whole thing and 99% of PC users will be unaffected or not know there is an issue. move on to the next node, take the PR hit now, Fix arrow lake. RMA bad units without pushback. "stop driving in the rear view mirror". I think this is where Intel will go (And I think it is correct).\n\nHowever if it gets to the point where it IS impacting Arrow lake sales, moves to AMD, then Intel will have to respond and the reaction will be "too slow to respond" and severe brand impact.

This issue is not just affecting gamers; it’s raising alarms within the gaming community and prompting several developers, including Epic Games, to take action.\n\nThese crashes often manifest as error messages indicating \'out of video memory,\' unexpectedly closing games, or even freezing systems entirely. The development teams behind popular games have begun advising users on how to mitigate problems linked to these processors. Epic Games has acknowledged the situation, stating they are working together with Intel to identify solutions and assist gamers experiencing these frustrating issues.\n\nReports suggest the root cause may stem from the acceleration settings set by motherboard manufacturers, which are known to push the power limits of these high-end processors beyond their specifications. Sentiments echoed by users indicate frustration over experiencing performance drops when changing these settings to improve stability.\n\nIntel confirmed they are aware of the problem and have started investigating the situation with major affiliates. "Intel is aware of problems related to executing specific tasks on 13th and 14th generation core processors for desktop PCs," said Intel spokesperson, confirming the undertaking of necessary analyses.\n\nEpic Games has provided clear recommendations for users, particularly stating the need to adjust their BIOS settings. Suggestions include changing the SVID Behavior setting to "Intel Fail Safe" to prevent potential overclocking issues which can lead to instability. This BIOS adjustment, which can be done on Asus, MSI, and Gigabyte motherboards, is intended to set power limits back to safer levels.\n\nFor many gamers, these BIOS settings to revert back to factory defaults are considered cumbersome. Many have opted to downclock or undervolt their processors using Intel’s Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU), resulting in noticeable improvements on system stability but at the cost of performance—a hit not all are willing to take. Some gaming studios have gone as far as advising players to switch to AMD processors altogether, reflecting the severity and urgency of the issue.\n\nComputer builders like Power GPU and others have also suggested tweaking high load settings to stabilize performance during intense gaming sessions. The well-known guideline to turn down the performance core multiplier by one or two notches can prevent many crashes. Despite these adjustment measures, the issue of stability persists, and users are still left to navigate the complex BIOS settings of their motherboards to seek stability.\n\nNotably, instances of people returning their Intel CPUs for AMD alternatives have become increasingly common, as daily reports from Korea suggest around ten returns per day just from pre-built systems advertising these problematic CPUs. Such trends may have factored heavily, pressuring Intel to finally take action on the situation instead of dismissing user reports as isolated incidents.\n\nDevelopers behind varied titles have echoed similar reports, stating issues are not solely restricted to one game. Titles such as _Hogwarts Legacy_, _Remnant 2_, and others have been affected. Fatshark, responsible for the _Vermintide_ series, advised players to adjust clock settings, cautioning against playing under high-stress conditions where overloading is likely.\n\nGame developers mentioned the need for optimizing performance particularly during shader compiling—a process known to heat up CPUs and disrupt performance stability. This unexpected crunch leads to higher power consumption, generating strain and chaos within the gaming experience.\n\nThese reports have led to potential repercussions for Intel, as multiple sources indicate law firms are beginning class-action lawsuit investigations related to the performance issues of the latest Core processors. The community may feel compelled to take legal action as the concerns about product reliability intensify.\n\nMeanwhile, the loyal fanbase of Intel CPUs is waiting to see how the tech giant will respond to these developments. There remains hope for swift resolution, especially as many Intel enthusiasts hold out for the release of the upcoming Arrow Lake-S desktop CPUs, but the sentiment of loss of confidence among users continues to grow each day.\n\nWith the gaming world constantly evolving and demanding higher standards and performances from technology, ensuring chip stability needs to be of utmost priority. This stabilizing act is not merely about fixing the current problems; it’s about restoring trust with consumers and maintaining competitive advantage.\n\nIntel’s troubleshooting does not stop here; the company continues to work closely with gaming studios, motherboard manufacturers, and the gaming community to support users stuck amid these technical issues. There’s much at stake for all players involved as the timeline for better solutions and stability measures begins to draw closer.\n\nWhile hardware and software issues are common within the tech world, the most recent challenges faced by Intel exemplify the delicate balance of power and performance. Just as the gaming community continues to adapt and push for better experiences, so too must industry leaders like Intel step up to the plate with their innovations and support frameworks for their technologies.\n\nWith enthusiasts and professionals alike rallying for clarity, it’s clear: Intel must take concrete steps to address and resolve these performance snags. Anything short of appropriate action risks alienation from its userbase as developers also keep close tabs on the debacle. The coming months will be pivotal for Intel, and only time will tell if they will regain the gamer’s confidence once lost amid these high-stakes crashes.\n\nSources\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/intel-is-investigating-game-crashes-on-top-end-core-i9-desktop-cpus/](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/intel-is-investigating-game-crashes-on-top-end-core-i9-desktop-cpus/)\n\n[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-guidelines-frequent-crashes-ifortnite-intel-14th-gen-13th-gen-cpus/](https://wccftech.com/epic-games-guidelines-frequent-crashes-ifortnite-intel-14th-gen-13th-gen-cpus/)\n\n[https://www.pcgamer.com/there-are-increased-reports-of-crashing-in-unreal-engine-games-etc-and-epic-is-blaming-intel-chips/](https://www.pcgamer.com/there-are-increased-reports-of-crashing-in-unreal-engine-games-etc-and-epic-is-blaming-intel-chips/)\n\n[https://www.techspot.com/news/102555-intel-finally-investigating-reports-high-end-13th-14th.html](https://www.techspot.com/news/102555-intel-finally-investigating-reports-high-end-13th-14th.html)\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125036/intel-game-crash-13900k-14900k-fortnite-unreal-engine-investigation](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125036/intel-game-crash-13900k-14900k-fortnite-unreal-engine-investigation)\n\nstatic.virgul.com\n\n# static.virgul.com is blocked\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n- Try disabling your extensions.\n\nERR\\_BLOCKED\\_BY\\_CLIENT\n\nReload\n\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nmc.yandex.com\n\n# mc.yandex.com is blocked\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n- Try disabling your extensions.\n\nERR\\_BLOCKED\\_BY\\_CLIENT\n\nReload\n\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)', 'metadata': {'twitter:description': 'Intel is facing mounting scrutiny as reports pile up about its top-tier CPUs, particularly the Core i9-13900K and i9-14900K, experiencing frequent crashes during…', 'fb:pages': '163940083664075', 'og:image': 'https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/6kIfnYbj3Bf0Cw1AS7CYCdua4Hg=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F8c94fe4d-a291-416a-bdfa-50d54cb8dd58.jpeg', 'msapplication-TileColor': ['#ffffff', '#ffffff'], 'google-site-verification': 'Tcg4zXyANfgpT7caz9CbSI34Bjoj8gj5qGzC35TE5jw', 'twitter:title': 'Intel Faces Backlash Over Core I9 CPU Crashes', 'ogUrl': 'https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/intel-faces-backlash-over-core-i9-cpu-crashes-6834', 'ogDescription': 'Intel is facing mounting scrutiny as reports pile up about its top-tier CPUs, particularly the Core i9-13900K and i9-14900K, experiencing frequent crashes during…', 'title': 'Intel Faces Backlash Over Core I9 CPU Crashes -

Someone responded that they wouldn\'t recommend the 14900 for gaming, and suggested the Intel Core i7-14700F 2.1 GHz 20-Core Processor instead.\n\nMy question is, does the CPU Thread Community here agree? More importantly, can you explain why? I just assumed, newer, faster, better...?\n\nI don\'t want something that\'s just good enough now. I want something that will be plenty good enough for at least a few years.\n\nMy prospective build, and what I\'m using it for below:\n\nCPU: Intel - Core i9-14900K Raptor Lake 3.2GHz Twenty Four-Core LGA 1700\n\nCPU cooler: Noctua - NH-D15S Chromax Black\n\nMotherboard: Gigabyte - Z790 AORUS Elite X WiFi 7 Intel LGA 1700 ATX\n\nRam: Corsair - Vengeance 64GB (2 x 32GB) DDR5-6000 PC5-48000 CL30 Dual Channel\n\nSSD/HDD: Crucial - T705 2TB Micron 232L TLC NAND PCIe Gen 5 x4 NVMe M.2 Internal SSD\n\nGPU: Gigabyte - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super Windforce V2 Triple Fan 16GB GDDR6X PCIe 4.0\n\nPSU: Lian Li - Edge 850 Watt 80 Plus Platinum ATX Fully Modular\n\nChassis: Lian Li - Lancool 216 Tempered Glass ATX Mid-Tower\n\nOS: Microsoft - Windows 11 Home 64-Bit FPP USB\n\nMonitor: MSI - MPG 321URX 32" 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) 240Hz Gaming Monitor\n\nMy goal with this build is to not have to worry about upgrading for awhile. 75% of the time I use my computer for very basic stuff (internet, editing travel videos and drone footage, microsoft office applications, etc...) The other 25% of the time would be for gaming. I\'m not a professional or anything, but I would like to play at, or close to, the highest settings, and if something new comes out in the next year or two, I don\'t want to worry if my system can handle it.

And this is totally on me, but I\'m not sure if I completely understand how to utilize this information for my build though, so let me know if I\'m on the right track here:\n\nRegarding the CPU... Right now, for my purposes, there isn\'t much advantage to the i9 over the i7. There might be in the long run, but only if the reliability issues have indeed been resolved. So I\'m basically rolling the dice? If I go with the i7, in two years I might need to upgrade. If I go with the i9 and there are issues, I might wish I went with the i7.\n\nAs for the GPU... Are you saying the 4080 Super is not all that powerful? Not that I necessarily need/want 4k capability right now, but the 4080 is pretty darn near the top of the line. Is the 4090 a big enough difference to justify the big jump in price for my build? Should I be waiting for the 50s? Or are you suggesting an AMD build?\n\nThanks again!\n\n[L](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/lafong.2901193/)\n\n#### [Lafong](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/lafong.2901193/)\n\n##### Dignified\n\nDec 2, 20216,0461,81715,690\n\n[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Veteran.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/veteran.32/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Renowned.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/renowned.65/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Journeyman.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/journeyman.31/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Platinum.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/platinum.45/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Laudable.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/laudable.64/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Gold.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/gold.44/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Initiate.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/initiate.30/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Palladium.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/palladium.43/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Famed.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/famed.63/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Mentor.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/mentor.14/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Windows_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/windows-10-expert.96/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/CasingCooling_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/cooling-expert.158/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Motherboard_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/motherboards-expert.78/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/ComputerBuilding_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/systems-expert.84/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Silver.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/silver.42/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Acolyte.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/acolyte.13/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Business%20Computing_1-Expert.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/storage-expert.90/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Adept.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/adept.12/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Honored.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/honored.62/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Titanium.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/titanium.41/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Respected.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/respected.61/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Steel.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/steel.40/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Neophyte.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/neophyte.11/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Bronze.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/bronze.39/)[![](https://forums.tomshardware.com/data/medias/svg/Remarkable.svg)](https://forums.tomshardware.com/trophies/remarkable.60/)\n\nAt one time, I saw a list of Intel CPUs that might be affected by the well known reliability issue.

I will not recommand what you list there, here are some reasons\n\n1st of all, using 14900 or not is really depends on what game and what setting you are going to use.\n\nBasically, if you are going to do 4K gaming, which is very obviously expected, the requirements for CPU goes lower while the requirments of GPU is higher. Especially in some AAA tiles, here is an extreme case, you heard the game named Black Myth Wukong? If you try to go some extreme setting, like running it on 4K DLAA, everything setting to high meanwhile turn off the frame generation, then 24 FPS is what you got with 4090. Even if you turn on the dlss to 75, with frame generation on, you will get something about 60-70 FPS and there is hardly any difference between R7 5700x3d and R7 9800X3D, why? Because in this case it just requires too much GPU power, even the strongest gaming GPU can do that much, while a fairly slow CPU does not make any difference, after all, as long as the CPU is not way to old, it is powerful enough to work out 60-70 FPS.\n\nHowever, if you are going to play those game in 1080P, or play those games that do not require that much GPU power, then, there is a day and night difference between CPUs, that is why almost all those so called CPU TESTs are done based on 1080P and 4090 graphic, low setting. Why? Because in that case, when GPU go full throttle, it can go that fast that almost no cpu can handle that speed, how many FPS eventually you get is all depends on how fast is your CPU\'s gaming power(this is another part I want to mention later), this is why there are some conlsuion says that 14900 is much worse than 7800X3D. I can not say that is wrong, however, it must not applies to your case cuz you are doing 4K. Even the future 5090 is unlikely to maxed out 14900\'s gaming power in 4k AAA tiles, 8090, 9090, maybe.\n\n2\\. About gaming power, first of all, you should understand that since AMD R7 5800X3D, cpus\' total power is not 100% transfered to gaming power. If you talk about gaming power, 5800X3D is strong, so strong that you can not even believe why it has that much gaming power while the productivity power is so low that it is painful to look at. Same problem applies to R7 7800X3D and R7 9800X3D, they both have more gaming power than I9 14900K. However, Do you really need it now if you play with 4K?\n\n3\\. Despite the problem mentioned [@geofelt](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/107382/) above, I believe that at least for now, you should stay away from any Intel CPU and MB. It is not just because its gaming power/ power consumption ratio is bad but also LGA1700 platform is already come to the end of its life. The new platform is LGA1851, only last 2 years. Meawhile, AMD primised that AM5 will be there until 2027, which means that if you buy your CPU and MB from AMD, even until 2028, you will still able to update to the lastest AMD CPU and there is no cost, most importantly, no need to worry about reinstall Winodws. Image that, if you build you PC now, after 3-4 years, you replaced the CPU and graphic, everything is back to the top, no need to reinstall windows, tranfer the files. How good is that?\n\nThus, here is my suggestion on you current list\n\nCPU, try AMD 9700X, both 7800x3d and 9800x3d are expensive, not worth it, remeber, if you are doing 4K, at least for recent years, you don\'t need that much gaming power from CPU.\n\nMB: Go Asus X670E creator if you can, if there is no such stock, try Asus X670E HERO, if still no stock, try Asus X670E PRIME. Remeber, it must be X670E since X870E mb is a joke, that AMD force all the AIC to use its 2ed PCI-E 5.0x4 lane that directly wired to CPU to run USB4, which means in X870E, you need to down grade your PCI-E 16X to 8X so that you can have more than 1 PCI-E 5.0X4 that is directly wired to CPU to use. A joke isn\'t it? You may also have to do a no cpu bios flash in this case. It is not hard.\n\nSSD: I highly suggest you to not use PCI-E 5.0 NVME SSD. It is way too expensive and way too hot, so hot that you may have to use its customized heatsink to make it work properly. Like this is not bad enough, it can not help you with any gaming expirence at all, why? because its 4K reading performance, which is the most important thing for gaming. In fact, if you talk about gaming, there is little noticeble difference beteween PCI-E 3.0 NVME SSDs and PCI-E 5.0 NVME SSDs. So save your money go something like KC3000 2T, more compacity is better than the speed, if you can, go 4T. Meanwhile buy a chip SATA SSD, such as Samsung evo 500G for your OS only. This is because when you are gaming, your windows will always read files from your OS disk, for the best performance, it will be good if you have a psyical independent disk for your OS. Of course, you can only have 4 M.2 disks and as I mentioned above, if you go amd, then this system will go with you for long time, maybe until 2032 you can still gaming on it. Over the years, there must be a lot of data, and you have only 4 M.2, better you save some for future.\n\nPSU: At least 1000w+, better 1200w, trust me, it is totally worth it. Why? Because this thing is going to stay there for very long time. More power means more room for you to upgrade, god knows how much power RTX8090 is going to draw? Better a little bit more rather than buying PSU again. However, it does not means that you have to spend too much, basically, any ATX3.0/3.1 PSU will do since there since ATX3.0/3.1 standard creates a high barrier of entry, there is no bad ATX3.0/3.1 PSU.\n\nCase: I am not really sure where you are, however, if you can, I highly suggest you to use [this case](https://www.newegg.com/p/2AM-00GU-00128?&srsltid=AfmBOopXM-hF6IiJ5VXeWDSYdruLTKw70Q26N8G4b6XZYLjn9GGb29l_),. It is a Chinese brand named Great wall. In china that case only cost about 40% comparing with US nevertheless it is totally worth it. It may not looks that fancy however this case has its unique and unreplacble advantage. I was never a fan of vertical GPU intallation until recent years, why? All the grahic cards are getting bigger and bigger. Look at RTX4090, how big it is? You can hardly use any other pci-e slot because they are blocked. However, for this case there is a way out, if you check the case carefully you will found out that it has 3 vertical PCI-E slots on top of 7 horizntal slots. Sure, there are some other cases like this but all of them have a glass side pannel, which means that if you use those 3 vertical slots to install your GPU it is very likely to go overheat since there is not enough room between the side pannel and GPU for air flow but for this case there is no such problem because instead of a glass side pannel, it has a iron side pannel with so many thermal holes on it. Meanwhile, when you do a vertical GPU installation, make sure you buy a longer PCI-E 16X extension cable and make it go over the top of those horizntal slots so that you can use other PCI-E slots again as long as you don\'t use any PCI-E cards that is taller than a standard PCI-E slot\'s hight. This is still not the best part, the best part is, you don\'t need to do it as long as you have the case. You only do it when you need to do it.

Especially in some AAA tiles, here is an extreme case, you heard the game named Black Myth Wukong? If you try to go some extreme setting, like running it on 4K DLAA, everything setting to high meanwhile turn off the frame generation, then 24 FPS is what you got with 4090. Even if you turn on the dlss to 75, with frame generation on, you will get something about 60-70 FPS and there is hardly any difference between R7 5700x3d and R7 9800X3D, why? Because in this case it just requires too much GPU power, even the strongest gaming GPU can do that much, while a fairly slow CPU does not make any difference, after all, as long as the CPU is not way to old, it is powerful enough to work out 60-70 FPS.\n>\n> However, if you are going to play those game in 1080P, or play those games that do not require that much GPU power, then, there is a day and night difference between CPUs, that is why almost all those so called CPU TESTs are done based on 1080P and 4090 graphic, low setting. Why? Because in that case, when GPU go full throttle, it can go that fast that almost no cpu can handle that speed, how many FPS eventually you get is all depends on how fast is your CPU\'s gaming power(this is another part I want to mention later), this is why there are some conlsuion says that 14900 is much worse than 7800X3D. I can not say that is wrong, however, it must not applies to your case cuz you are doing 4K. Even the future 5090 is unlikely to maxed out 14900\'s gaming power in 4k AAA tiles, 8090, 9090, maybe.\n>\n> 2\\. About gaming power, first of all, you should understand that since AMD R7 5800X3D, cpus\' total power is not 100% transfered to gaming power. If you talk about gaming power, 5800X3D is strong, so strong that you can not even believe why it has that much gaming power while the productivity power is so low that it is painful to look at. Same problem applies to R7 7800X3D and R7 9800X3D, they both have more gaming power than I9 14900K. However, Do you really need it now if you play with 4K?\n>\n> 3\\. Despite the problem mentioned [@geofelt](https://forums.tomshardware.com/members/107382/) above, I believe that at least for now, you should stay away from any Intel CPU and MB. It is not just because its gaming power/ power consumption ratio is bad but also LGA1700 platform is already come to the end of its life. The new platform is LGA1851, only last 2 years. Meawhile, AMD primised that AM5 will be there until 2027, which means that if you buy your CPU and MB from AMD, even until 2028, you will still able to update to the lastest AMD CPU and there is no cost, most importantly, no need to worry about reinstall Winodws. Image that, if you build you PC now, after 3-4 years, you replaced the CPU and graphic, everything is back to the top, no need to reinstall windows, tranfer the files. How good is that?\n>\n> Thus, here is my suggestion on you current list\n>\n> CPU, try AMD 9700X, both 7800x3d and 9800x3d are expensive, not worth it, remeber, if you are doing 4K, at least for recent years, you don\'t need that much gaming power from CPU.\n>\n> MB: Go Asus X670E creator if you can, if there is no such stock, try Asus X670E HERO, if still no stock, try Asus X670E PRIME. Remeber, it must be X670E since X870E mb is a joke, that AMD force all the AIC to use its 2ed PCI-E 5.0x4 lane that directly wired to CPU to run USB4, which means in X870E, you need to down grade your PCI-E 16X to 8X so that you can have more than 1 PCI-E 5.0X4 that is directly wired to CPU to use. A joke isn\'t it? You may also have to do a no cpu bios flash in this case. It is not hard.\n>\n> SSD: I highly suggest you to not use PCI-E 5.0 NVME SSD. It is way too expensive and way too hot, so hot that you may have to use its customized heatsink to make it work properly. Like this is not bad enough, it can not help you with any gaming expirence at all, why? because its 4K reading performance, which is the most important thing for gaming. In fact, if you talk about gaming, there is little noticeble difference beteween PCI-E 3.0 NVME SSDs and PCI-E 5.0 NVME SSDs. So save your money go something like KC3000 2T, more compacity is better than the speed, if you can, go 4T. Meanwhile buy a chip SATA SSD, such as Samsung evo 500G for your OS only. This is because when you are gaming, your windows will always read files from your OS disk, for the best performance, it will be good if you have a psyical independent disk for your OS. Of course, you can only have 4 M.2 disks and as I mentioned above, if you go amd, then this system will go with you for long time, maybe until 2032 you can still gaming on it. Over the years, there must be a lot of data, and you have only 4 M.2, better you save some for future.\n>\n> PSU: At least 1000w+, better 1200w, trust me, it is totally worth it. Why? Because this thing is going to stay there for very long time. More power means more room for you to upgrade, god knows how much power RTX8090 is going to draw? Better a little bit more rather than buying PSU again. However, it does not means that you have to spend too much, basically, any ATX3.0/3.1 PSU will do since there since ATX3.0/3.1 standard creates a high barrier of entry, there is no bad ATX3.0/3.1 PSU.\n>\n> Case: I am not really sure where you are, however, if you can, I highly suggest you to use [this case](https://www.newegg.com/p/2AM-00GU-00128?&srsltid=AfmBOopXM-hF6IiJ5VXeWDSYdruLTKw70Q26N8G4b6XZYLjn9GGb29l_),. It is a Chinese brand named Great wall. In china that case only cost about 40% comparing with US nevertheless it is totally worth it. It may not looks that fancy however this case has its unique and unreplacble advantage. I was never a fan of vertical GPU intallation until recent years, why? All the grahic cards are getting bigger and bigger. Look at RTX4090, how big it is? You can hardly use any other pci-e slot because they are blocked. However, for this case there is a way out, if you check the case carefully you will found out that it has 3 vertical PCI-E slots on top of 7 horizntal slots. Sure, there are some other cases like this but all of them have a glass side pannel, which means that if you use those 3 vertical slots to install your GPU it is very likely to go overheat since there is not enough room between the side pannel and GPU for air flow but for this case there is no such problem because instead of a glass side pannel, it has a iron side pannel with so many thermal holes on it. Meanwhile, when you do a vertical GPU installation, make sure you buy a longer PCI-E 16X extension cable and make it go over the top of those horizntal slots so that you can use other PCI-E slots again as long as you don\'t use any PCI-E cards that is taller than a standard PCI-E slot\'s hight. This is still not the best part, the best part is, you don\'t need to do it as long as you have the case. You only do it when you need to do it.

AM5 has upgrade options well into the future. 13th and 14th gen have issues.

The higher you go with any hardware the less value you get for your money. Also for gaming, the GPU generally contributes more to overall game performance than the CPU for the same amount of money.\n\nThe increase in performance you get from high-end hardware is laughable, to be honest. For example an rtx 2080-ti will get you an average of +33% more performance in games compared to a rtx 2060s at triple the price.

Now consider that GPU contributes more to your overall gaming experience and you can see that for CPUs this gets even worse. For example a 10900k will on average perform about 5% better than a 10600k at double the price.\n\nFor gaming, you should generally aim for i3/r3 for entry-level, i5/r5 for your average gaming rig, and i7/r7 for high-end gaming. An r9 is generally more of a consumer workstation CPU and an i9 is just a slightly better i7 which is also better suited for workstation tasks than for gaming (for its price). Generally speaking, an i5/r5 is the best value, while the i7/r7 are the best reasonably priced performance.\n\nHowever if you had to choose between an i5/r5, i7/r7 and i9/r9 and the saved money would go into your GPU budget, than the i5/r5 are probably the best pick. Also as a general tip, don\'t worry about bottlenecking your GPU. Any recent i3/r3+ can run all consumer GPUs just fine.\n\nUpvote ·\n96\n\n95\n\nPromoted by Asana\n\n[![Profile photo for Asana, Inc.](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-2085029710-50-wurivyxpwkxytspvzevhpngdkgzqarvn.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Asana-Inc)\n\n[Asana, Inc.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Asana-Inc)\n\nTrack, manage, and connect your projects across any team\n\n·\xa0[Jan 6](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-project-management-tools-for-managers/answer/Asana-Inc)\n\nWhat are the best project management tools for managers?\n\nIf you’re managing a team or program, you might have multiple projects in progress at the same time.

So, my advice is get the best i7 or ryzen 7 you can afford, as they will perform at the same level as an i9 or Ryzen 9 in games. But if you do more than gaming, such as 3D or video rendering, more cores will benefit your work.\n\nNote: CPU is much less of a concern if you are gaming at higher than QHD/1440p i.e. Ultrawide QHD, 4k etc, so any recent i5 or ryzen 5 (13th gen and later/ryzen 7000) will perform similar to an i9 or ryzen 9, as games are mostly GPU limited/bottlenecked at these higher resolutions.\n\nUpvote ·\n91\n\n[![Profile photo for John (GrabCash.xyz)](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-936304030-50-wrmkkmlepwtxyzgibjczvvdvpmgwnywi.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/John-GrabCash-xyz)\n\n[John (GrabCash.xyz)](https://www.quora.com/profile/John-GrabCash-xyz)\n\nMarketing Specialist at Hewlett-Packard (company) (2022–present) · Author has 12.4K answers and 72.7M answer views\n\n·\xa0[1y](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Intel-i9-12900K-overkill-for-gaming/answer/John-GrabCash-xyz)\n\nOriginally Answered: [Is the Intel i9 12900K overkill for gaming?](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Intel-i9-12900K-overkill-for-gaming?no_redirect=1) ·\n\nThe Intel Core i9-12900K is a high-end processor featuring Intel\'s Alder Lake architecture.

Whether it is overkill for gaming depends on various factors, including your specific gaming needs, budget considerations, and future-proofing intentions.\n\nHere are some considerations:\n\n1. Gaming Performance:For most gaming scenarios, a processor like the i9-12900K may be considered overkill. Many modern games are more GPU-dependent than CPU-dependent. In gaming, the graphics card (GPU) often has a more significant impact on performance than the CPU.\n2. Other Tasks:If you also engage in tasks that benefit from a powerful CPU, such as content creation, video editing, 3D rendering, or streaming, the i9-12900K\'s high core count and performance may be more justified.\n3. Budget:High-end processors often come with a higher price tag. If you are on a tight budget and your primary use is gaming, you might consider allocating more of your budget to a high-performance graphics card rather than an extremely powerful CPU.\n4. Future-Proofing:If you\'re looking for a system that will remain relevant and performant for several years, investing in a high-end CPU might provide a level of future-proofing. However, keep in mind that gaming performance improvements often come from advancements in graphics technology.\n5. Alternative CPUs:Depending on your needs, you might also consider other CPUs in Intel\'s or AMD\'s lineup that offer excellent gaming performance at a potentially more cost-effective price point.\n\nUltimately, the decision on whether the i9-12900K is overkill for gaming depends on your specific use case, preferences, and budget. It\'s always a good idea to consider the overall balance of your system, ensuring that both the CPU and GPU are well-matched to provide optimal performance for your intended tasks.

Types of Games:\n\n    \\- CPU-Intensive Games: If you play games that are heavily CPU-dependent (like strategy games or simulation games), an i9 can provide significant performance benefits.\n\n    \\- GPU-Intensive Games: For most modern AAA titles, performance is often more dependent on the GPU. In these cases, a high-end i7 or even an i5 might be sufficient.\n2. Resolution and Settings:\n\n    \\- At lower resolutions (like 1080p), the CPU can become a bottleneck, making a high-end CPU more beneficial.\n\n    \\- At higher resolutions (1440p or 4K), the GPU plays a more critical role, and the difference between an i7 and i9 may not be noticeable.\n3. Future-Proofing:\n\n    \\- If you want to future-proof your system for upcoming games and software that might utilize more CPU power, an i9 could be a good investment.\n4. Multitasking and Streaming:\n\n    \\- If you plan to stream while gaming or run other applications simultaneously, an i9\'s extra cores and threads can help with performance.\n5. Budget:\n\n    \\- i9 processors are more expensive. If you’re on a tight budget, consider whether the performance gains justify the price compared to an i7 or an equivalent.\n\nConclusion:\n\nFor most gamers, an i7 or even an i5 will suffice, especially if gaming is the primary use. An i9 is more suitable for those who want top-tier performance, plan to multitask heavily, or play CPU-intensive titles. If your budget allows and you want the best possible performance, go for it, but it’s not strictly necessary for gaming alone.\n\nUpvote ·\n\n[![Profile photo for Fredrick Miller](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-365295779-50-agzesgvcspzrpqmvptkpcsznmperbxpr.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Fredrick-Miller)\n\n[Fredrick Miller](https://www.quora.com/profile/Fredrick-Miller)\n\nFormer Process Automation (1977–2009) · Author has 1.1K answers and 894.2K answer views\n\n·\xa0[5y](https://www.quora.com/Is-an-i9-overkill/answer/Fredrick-Miller)\n\nOriginally Answered: [Is an i9 overkill?](https://www.quora.com/Is-an-i9-overkill?no_redirect=1) ·\n\nIt depends on your budget and your use.\n\nWhere to spend your money is a good question to answer.

Going from a SATA drive to one that pugs into a PCI slot will also greatly boost performance.\n\nHaving more system memory can also boost performance if your motherboard supports it and you are page faulting.\n\nA better video controller will also help.\n\nIn my early evaluation of multiprocessor systems each CPU added required about 5% of all available processors. That means more cores mean more waiting for memory and I/O and waiting for one core to complete a required operation that impacts both cores.\n\nMy conclusion is if you know how to use the tools provided by the OS to measure where you need to improve performance then do that first.\n\nThus if your i9 is only going to give you bragging rights it is overkill.\n\nUpvote ·\n91\n\nPromoted by Grammarly\n\n[![Profile photo for Grammarly](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-1117688072-50-uscgmxxxnncsmrckmzmmvijfwxtlacfm.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Grammarly)\n\n[Grammarly](https://www.quora.com/profile/Grammarly)\n\nGreat Writing, Simplified\n\n·\xa0[Updated 2y](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-effectively-edit-my-own-writing/answer/Grammarly)\n\nHow can I effectively edit my own writing?\n\nSo, you think you’ve drafted a tweet, an email, a short story, or even a novel.

These are different forms of communication, but the process of bringing them to fruition has a necessary, sometimes overlooked step: editing! Unless you’re a professional writer, it’s unlikely that you have an editor who can review your writing regularly. Here are some tips to help you review your own work.\n\n1. Give your writing some space. Have you ever felt a mix of pure relief and joy when you’ve finished a draft of something? Don’t downplay that feeling and the ability to walk away from your work before you start editing it. You may need minutes, hours, or days, but once you sit back down with what you originally had on the page, you’ll have the thrill of looking at it with fresh eyes. You’ll notice errors you may not have seen the first time. You’ll come to new realizations about its overall tone and structure. If it’s a text or email, maybe you only need a few minutes away from it. If it’s a story or essay, perhaps you’ll need longer. Regardless of what type of work it is, it will help your writing tremendously.\n2. Don’t use overachieving synonyms. Looking at your work for the second, third, or fourth time around may inspire you to spice up your language with longer, more uncommon words. There’s nothing wrong with having a thesaurus nearby, but try to limit the repetition of long, pretentious-feeling words so your work flows well and doesn’t feel too bogged down. At the end of the day, you want it to feel true to you and the message you’re conveying.\n3. Remember who the reader is. Don’t forget your own voice as the writer—but don’t forget who your reader is. Many writers get too close to their work; editing is a chance to try to get out of your own head. Who is your ideal reader? What do you want them to take away from the writing? It’s a unique time to step in their shoes, to make sure your communication is as effective as you’d like it to be.\n4. Kill your darlings. Don’t be scared to remove chunks of your work, even if it feels precious to you. If it’s a passage that’s really tough to part with, try saving it somewhere else, so you can return to it later in your piece or for another work.\n5. Use Grammarly. Last but not least, [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/a?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=promotedanswers&utm_content=effectivelyeditwriting&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106235110191%7C0 "www.grammarly.com") has countless resources for editing your work.

I decided to add $500 every month. At the time, it felt like a stretch—I had bills to pay and other priorities—but I stuck with it.\n\nToday, that account has grown to over $140,000. In another 10 years, it should be worth around $350,000. That single decision gave me the financial freedom I never thought I’d have. Today, I tell my friends to do the same. You can go to a site like [SavingsPro](https://savingspro.org/the-best-ways-for-to-invest/?s1=Q_A_Choice_DT_C&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106241805163%7C0 "savingspro.org") and select one of the investment platforms that’s offering a bonus for opening an account.\n\nNext, I tackled my car insurance.\n\nI’d been overpaying for years because I thought loyalty to my insurer would save me money—it didn’t. One afternoon, I spent 10 minutes on [Coverage.com](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_A_Choice_DT_C&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106241805163%7C0 "www.myfinance.com") comparing offers and ended up saving $1100 a year by switching. That extra money went straight into my investments. If you haven’t shopped your policy around on [a comparison site like this](https://www.myfinance.com/reporting/32350533/?mf_utm_campaign=savingspro2-auto-insurance-flow-link&s1=Q_A_Choice_DT_C&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106241805163%7C0 "www.myfinance.com"), you’re probably overpaying too.\n\nDebt relief was another game-changer.\n\nLike many people, at one point I had built up a little credit card debt—$15,000, to be exact. I felt stuck, paying minimums and barely chipping away at the balance. Then I found [this debt relief program](https://www.bankrate.com/landing/savingspro/best-debt-relief-options/?s1=Q_A_Choice_DT_C&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106241805163%7C0 "www.bankrate.com") that reduced what I owed and within two years, I was debt-free.

Then I [switched to a high-interest account](https://savingspro.org/savings-rates/?s1=Q_A_Choice_DT_C&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106241805163%7C0 "savingspro.org") offering over 4.00%. Watching my savings grow without lifting a finger was incredibly rewarding. [Here’s a list](https://savingspro.org/savings-rates/?s1=Q_A_Choice_DT_C&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106241805163%7C0 "savingspro.org") of the best accounts to help you get started.\n\nFinally, I fixed my credit.\n\nBad credit can hold you back in ways you don’t even realize—from higher insurance premiums to difficulty renting apartments. I used one of the [options listed on Bankrate to fix it](https://www.bankrate.com/landing/savingspro/credit-repair/?s1=Q_A_Choice_DT_C&qclid=617538130683215093%7C211106241805163%7C0 "www.bankrate.com"). Within a year, my credit score improved by 220 points.\n\nThese decisions weren’t massive or life-altering in the moment, but looking back, they completely changed my life.

However, the i7–8700 and any i5 or i3 processor from the 8th gen just do not make sense for mostpeople. Why? Because of Ryzen.\n\nAll Ryzen CPUs above Ryzen 3s are hyperthreaded and all of them are capable of overclocking. They also come with great stock coolers (which the K-series Intel chips don’t even have). Many AAA titles are starting to use 12 threads or more (such as Battlefield 1), so if you game on an i5–8600K for instance, it will become stuttery in demanding multiplayer lobbies because of the lack of threads, whereas on a Ryzen 5 2600X, it may not get the highest maximum fps, but it will be a lot smoother.\n\nHowever, the K range of Intel chips (8700K, 8600K and 8350K) do make sense if the games you play need high single core performance. Simulator games such as Flight Simulator X and OMSI 2 need high single core performance more than they need a fancy GPU, so for those situations, get Intel.\n\nOtherwise, get AMD.\n\nUpvote ·\n9943\n\n92\n\n95\n\n[![Profile photo for Brett Bergan](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-233327541-50-ryuueepityybhwbzcduicutierxjiwht.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brett-Bergan)\n\n[Brett Bergan](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brett-Bergan)\n\nBuilding PC\'s for 25 years · Author has 8.5K answers and 148.8M answer views\n\n·\xa0[3y](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-i9-10900K-regarded-as-the-best-gaming-processor-what-happened-to-the-i9-11900K-and-the-i9-12900K/answer/Brett-Bergan)\n\nRelated\n\nWhy is the i9-10900K regarded as the best gaming processor, what happened to the i9-11900K and the i9-12900K?\n\nThe 12900K blows the 10900K out of the water.\n\nThat being said, the 10900K does have ten actual high-performance cores while the 12900K still only has eight.\n\nIf the 10900K were considered to be “better” than the 12900K it would be so in the respect that the 12900K can crash in some games that do not effectively distinguish between E-cores and P-cores.

This is an issue that Widows 11 intends to address and fix. Obviously it is not quite there yet.\n\nThe i9–11900K has the readily evident deficiency of having eight cores instead of ten, which, with all else being equal would limit it to 80% of the 10900K’s max performance numbers. IRL, however, the 11900K manages to only fall behind the 10900K by about 5%, and does much better in many optimized productivity tasks due to new-gen features.\n\nThe massive improvements I see with 12th gen gaming is in the 1% lows. With the extra cores, the CPU can keep doing what CPU’s do without having to get sidetracked and allowing frame rates to dip. This is a major factor I have seen in the transition from the six-core i5 (8600K 9600K) to the hyperthreaded six-core (10600K) namely the CPU performs extremely well al the time instead of experiencing frame-time spikes. The 12600K blows them all out of the water with its ability to do system tasks on the E-cores while letting its six core/twelve thread P-Core complex give 100% attention to gaming.\n\nThis comparison shows the steady improvement from one gen to the next witht huge leap in performance going from single-thread to hyperthreading in the 10600K\n\n![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4a9f1c4ee48655e1fe096c17ab4dbfb2-pjlq)\n\n> F1 and Cyberpunk both showed this oddity with HT cores beating the ST core at 1080, but being the same at 1440—only showing improvements in the 1% lows.\n\nMost games thus are mostly not limited by CPU performance, and it is not uncommon for a 10600K to match (or on rare occasions beat) the 12900K. One game benchmark (AC:Valhalla) saw the 9600K beating out the rest of the field.\n\n![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8df33bfab1a7a7298e2d3ac84041306d-pjlq)\n\n> Go Figure. Valhalla is obviously extremely GPU bound as is Control, which saw exactly zero difference regardless of the CPU used.\n\nProbably less than half the games tested followed the expected stair-step progression in frame rate performance shown here by Watch Dogs Legion.\n\n![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cb6edfff8b7bedef5e94908242291c9a-pjlq)\n\nIf your game of choice is Watch Dogs Legion and you have or plan to get a RTX 3080 and play at 1080p, then yes, you probably should spend the extra hundred or two for a 12600K or a 12700K. But once you move to 1440p or use a slower graphics card, it becomes harder to justify spending a lot more on a CPU.\n\nKeep in mind as well that you have other options. The i5–11400 with unlocked power limits can come within spitting distance of a 11600K, and is selling fro a very reasonable $189—compared to $165 for the i5–10400. The 10400 is BETTER (faster and more efficient) than the 11400 at stock speeds. But once the limits are off, the 11400 can pull well ahead, as I said, very close to the 11600K.\n\nYou have options. Unfortunately some super secret performance trick always ends up on a big youtube channel and pretty soon you have eleven million people all clamoring for the same oddball CPU and the price goes sky high while inventory is ransacked. This is what happened to the Ryzen 3 3300X. It really is no better than an i3–10100, but the hype-train made you believe that this miracle CPU was the actual second coming of Jesus himself.\n\nUpvote ·\n999209\n\n9922\n\n95\n\n[![Profile photo for Diistriict](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-338794684-50-vucnreqduiqnqmanmxtgnfzcqxcnrnme.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Diistriict)\n\n[Diistriict](https://www.quora.com/profile/Diistriict)\n\nStudied Master of Commerce at University of Delhi (Graduated 2020) · Author has 244 answers and 172.1K answer views\n\n·\xa0[3y](https://www.quora.com/Is-Ryzen-9-overkill-for-gaming/answer/Diistriict)\n\nRelated\n\nIs Ryzen 9 overkill for gaming?\n\nDon’t forget to follow me on Instagram, insta id \\[ diistriict \\]\n\nYes, the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is an excellent choice for gaming, if a bit pricey.

Its 12 cores might be a little overkill for gaming, but its raw processing speed puts it at the top against any and all competition.\n\nThe biggest reason the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is good for gaming is one thing: It\'s incredibly fast. A lot of computer processors are fast, but the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is the kind of fast that\'s made to make your games run well. A lot of it comes down to the way the processor is built. Unlike its Intel competition, the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X tightens the design so that each of its 12 cores has an easier time accessing information. Because of that, your games will run smoother, especially if they\'re not particularly core-hungry. There\'s a reason AMD\'s processors are incredibly popular even in laptops.\n\nThis is notable, because the processor itself has a lot more cores than you really need for most games. For most people, 12 cores is pointless for gaming, but it\'s how they\'re designed that matters when it comes to how quickly your graphics card can render out frames of your beautiful game on your monitor. This gets even more important if you\'re someone who plays on a 1440p or 4K monitor at frame rates above 60 per second.\n\nWithout wading into the swamp of technical details about the complex ways processors interact with your RAM and GPU to run your games, all you need to know is that the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X makes particular design choices that increase the overall speeds compared to previous intretions. Specifically, it\'s the way each core is physically closer to each other and the L3 cache, providing more efficient ways to grab information. This leads to the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X having a faster IPC, or instructions per clock than its clock speed might imply.\n\nIt\'s the main reason the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is good for gaming, and frankly, a lot of other intensive operations. Without this specific design choice, the cores would take longer to render a game and those delays could add up to a noticeable lack in performance. The AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is unique because it\'s built to fuel your PC when it\'s trying to run a demanding game.\n\nHere\'s the biggest catch about the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X when it comes to gaming and, well, everything. It\'s incredibly hard to get still. In part because of the state of the world and because a ton of people really wanted to build powerful PCs lately, the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is a really, really tough chip to get. It\'s also expensive, coming in at $50 MSRP (a price you won\'t see a ton still because of the intense demand) over the last generation\'s high-end option.\n\nThat puts it at $549 which is pretty steep, especially when the gains aren\'t huge if you already have a previous Ryzen CPU. At the same time though, if you want to future-proof yourself, it\'s close to competitive pricing for anything close to its power out there.\n\nThank’you :)\n\nUpvote ·\n\n[![Profile photo for Tom Battraw](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-263463919-50-pcocnkvwaznmbhtouykicpbnkniywctt.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tom-Battraw)\n\n[Tom Battraw](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tom-Battraw)\n\nI research all the cool gizmos I can\'t afford · Author has 505 answers and 2.4M answer views\n\n·\xa0[5y](https://www.quora.com/Are-i9-processors-good-for-gaming/answer/Tom-Battraw?no_redirect=1)\n\nRelated\n\nAre i9 processors good for gaming?\n\nThis entirely depends on the type of i9 in question.\n\nDesktop, non-HEDT i9s such as the i9–9900K are remarkably good for gaming: they have blisteringly fast single-core and quad core speeds, which are the most important for gaming.

The latest 16″ MacBook Pro usually can only eke out single-digit FPS improvements when upgrading to the more expensive i9 and GPU, largely due to thermal issues.\n\nIn the end, i7s and i9s tend to be very similar for gaming. Unless you also edit videos or do other CPU-intensive work on the side, or just have piles of money sitting around waiting to be spent, you should probably stick with an i7 and call it good.\n\nUpvote ·\n9916\n\n[![Profile photo for Francis](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-73059017-50-rushtfyqismtuutsgmctxjljwkafowvk.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Francis-765)\n\n[Francis](https://www.quora.com/profile/Francis-765)\n\nAnalyst at National Health Service (NHS) (2008–present) · Author has 10.2K answers and 59.5M answer views\n\n·\xa0[4y](https://www.quora.com/Is-a-Core-i9-processor-overkill-for-most-users/answer/Francis-765)\n\nRelated\n\nIs a Core i9 processor overkill for most users?\n\nI seldom answer questions using memes.

Note that high resolutions bottleneck the video card, not the CPU. The higher the frame rate, the harder the CPU has to work to provide the data to the video card. That’s why high resolutions and/or high settings, which pull down the frame rate towards 60fps, don’t tend to bottleneck due to the CPU. Lower resolutions ( e.g. trying to reach 120fps for a 120hz monitor) require the CPU to work harder.\n\nUnder some scenarios, at lower resolutions, when trying to reach high frame rates, you might bottleneck some video cards with the i5. And in some cases, perhaps having more cores could help. That’s a lot of “perhaps” for spending a few hundred more for the i7 and i9, but I don’t think it’s a foolish waste of money. Just a bit fiscally unsound for a gaming only rig, where the 6 cores of the i5 seem sufficient.\n\nNote that your single threaded performance is roughly the same for the i5, i7 and i9 processors, depending on your overclock ( if getting a K processor.) I can push close to 5 Ghz with my i5-9600K.\n\nUpvote ·\n94\n\n[![Profile photo for Joe Morgan](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-926879047-50-pppluumjgwqduukltyzubilsxxaardus.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Joe-Morgan-220)\n\n[Joe Morgan](https://www.quora.com/profile/Joe-Morgan-220)\n\nAuthor has 788 answers and 642.3K answer views\n\n·\xa0[Oct 7](https://www.quora.com/Which-processor-an-i5-or-an-i7-is-recommended-for-high-end-gaming-Are-there-any-notable-differences-between-the-two-when-it-comes-to-gaming-performance/answer/Joe-Morgan-220)\n\nRelated\n\nWhich processor, an i5 or an i7, is recommended for high-end gaming?

As of my last update in September 2021, Intel\'s Core i9 processors were among the highest-performing consumer-grade CPUs, typically targeted at gamers, content creators, and professionals who demand top-tier performance.\n\nTo understand why i9 processors are suitable for gaming, let\'s explore some key aspects:\n\n1. High Core Count and Clock Speeds: Most Intel Core i9 processors feature a high core count, often ranging from 8 to 18 cores, with Hyper-Threading enabled. Hyper-Threading allows each physical core to handle two threads, effectively doubling the number of threads. The high core count and Hyper-Threading capability enable i9 processors to handle multi-threaded workloads efficiently, which is beneficial for certain gaming scenarios and multi-tasking.\n\nMoreover, i9 processors typically have high clock speeds, especially when using Intel\'s Turbo Boost technology. Turbo Boost allows the processor to dynamically increase its clock speed when required, providing an extra performance boost for demanding tasks like gaming.\n\n1. Single-Core Performance: Gaming performance is significantly influenced by single-core performance, as most games are not optimized to utilize a large number of cores and threads efficiently. In this regard, i9 processors shine with their strong single-core performance, enabling smooth gameplay and high frame rates in single-threaded game titles.\n2. Overclocking Potential: Many Intel Core i9 processors, especially the "K" and "KF" models, are unlocked, allowing users to overclock them. Overclocking involves increasing the clock speed of the processor beyond its stock settings. When done correctly and with appropriate cooling, overclocking can boost gaming performance even further, providing an edge in certain CPU-intensive games.\n3. Integrated Graphics: Most Intel Core i9 processors for desktops do not come with integrated graphics since they are intended for use with dedicated graphics cards. However, some i9 processors designed for laptops (H-series) do come with integrated graphics, offering power-saving features and enabling basic gaming without a dedicated GPU.\n4. Pairing with High-End Graphics Cards: For optimal gaming performance, pairing an i9 processor with a high-end graphics card is crucial. The GPU plays a more significant role in gaming performance than the CPU, especially at higher resolutions and graphical settings. High-end graphics cards, such as NVIDIA\'s RTX 30 series or AMD\'s Radeon RX 6000 series, can deliver excellent gaming experiences when combined with an i9 processor.\n5. Memory and Storage: The performance of gaming systems is also influenced by the amount and speed of RAM (memory) and storage options. Having sufficient and fast RAM, such as DDR4 or DDR5, ensures smooth loading times and minimizes in-game stutters. Additionally, using a fast storage solution, like NVMe SSDs, can further enhance loading times and system responsiveness.\n6. Cooling and Thermal Management: Due to their high performance, i9 processors can generate significant heat under heavy workloads, such as gaming. It is essential to pair the i9 processor with an efficient cooling solution to maintain optimal performance and prevent thermal throttling, where the CPU reduces its clock speed to prevent overheating. Aftermarket cooling solutions like high-end air coolers or liquid cooling can help keep temperatures in check during extended gaming sessions.\n7. Future-Proofing: Investing in an i9 processor can provide a level of future-proofing for your gaming system. While gaming performance primarily relies on the GPU, having a powerful CPU can help ensure that the system remains relevant for more demanding games and applications in the years to come.\n\nIn summary, Intel Core i9 processors are indeed well-suited for gaming due to their high core counts, strong single-core performance, overclocking potential, and overall high-performance capabilities. Paired with a high-end graphics card, fast RAM, and a capable cooling solution, an i9 processor can deliver a premium gaming experience with smooth frame rates, improved graphical fidelity, and reduced loading times.\n\nHowever, it\'s essential to consider your specific needs and budget when choosing a processor for gaming. While i9 processors offer top-tier performance, they come at a premium price compared to other CPU options like Intel Core i7 processors or AMD\'s Ryzen series, which also provide excellent gaming performance at more affordable price points.\n\nAs technology advances, new processors and graphics cards are continuously released, offering improved performance and features. It\'s crucial to stay informed about the latest hardware releases, read reviews, and consider real-world benchmarks to make an informed decision that aligns with your gaming needs and budget.\n\nUpvote ·\n\n[![Profile photo for Brett Bergan](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-233327541-50-ryuueepityybhwbzcduicutierxjiwht.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brett-Bergan)\n\n[Brett Bergan](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brett-Bergan)\n\nBuilding PC\'s for 25 years · Author has 8.5K answers and 148.8M answer views\n\n·\xa0[4y](https://www.quora.com/How-strong-is-an-i9-9900KS-in-gaming-performance/answer/Brett-Bergan)\n\nRelated\n\nHow strong is an i9-9900KS in gaming performance?\n\nThe problem with these insane gaming CPU’s is that there is nothing short of a RTX Titan in SLI running at 1080p that can really max it out unless you are shooting for 750fps in CS:GO.\n\nThe 9900KS and the 10900K are about equal when being tested with a RTX 2080 Ti, but that is probably because the GPU is just too weak to show the difference between the two.\n\n![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c172605b2e18af3450c5bedd290851f3-lq)\n\nThese are very typical results with averages and lows within 1–2fps.

But it never really hurts to have too much CPU or RAM, it can only help. The real key to a gaming system is the GPU and GDDR as they do most of the heavy lifting for a gaming system. Of course, your hard drive will also affect the gaming so make sure you have a fast NVMe drive for best performance.\n\nYou can build a very nice gaming system off of a current gen i7 or i5 or similar AMD cpu’s with 16GB RAM and a decent NVMe drive for relatively low cost. Where you want to spend your money is on the video card.\n\nUpvote ·\n91\n\n91\n\n[![Profile photo for Nitish Lakra](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-669047092-50-wzqfindborugsmfxyxfkbomtnocncmam.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Nitish-Lakra-12)\n\n[Nitish Lakra](https://www.quora.com/profile/Nitish-Lakra-12)\n\nSenior Writer at SkyGPU (2022–present) · Author has 277 answers and 3.2M answer views\n\n·\xa0[1y](https://www.quora.com/Are-i9-processors-good-for-gaming/answer/Nitish-Lakra-12?no_redirect=1)\n\nRelated\n\nAre i9 processors good for gaming?\n\nYes, because of their high core counts and clock rates, i9 CPUs are typically suitable for gaming.

A quad-core CPU is actually considered the baseline in modern PC gaming, and more is better.\n\nUntil a few years ago, single-threaded performance was the undisputed king of gaming applications. Most tasks in a gaming engine were handled by just a single thread, with only occasional off-loading to a second. Under those circumstances, a fast dual-core CPU was enough.

In fact, if you’re building a dedicated gaming rig for MMO’s and games two years old or older, there’s no better deal than the Pentium G3258—an unlocked, non-hyperthreaded dual-core Haswell with an unlocked multiplier. You don’t need anything better; just put the G3258 on a motherboard that allows for overclocking, and clock the chip as high as it will go.\n\nHowever, the latest titles do need more than one or two threads. Part of that is because a lot of PC games are ported from the consoles, and the current generation of consoles, the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One, actually use an eight-core x86 CPU sourced from AMD. Because this CPU doesn’t have great single-core performance, but does have many threads (six of the eight are available for game programming), new titles on the consoles are written to spread work across multiple simultaneous threads as much as possible. As the games get ported to PC, it remains important to have multiple threads available. Some new titles won’t even run on a dual-core with no HT without being hacked, and then they run choppy.\n\nFor this reason, I don’t recommend the G3258 anymore for budget gaming rigs, instead pointing people in the direction of AMD’s Athlon 860/870/880K series of quad-core chips if on a tight budget, or the Intel i5–6600K for higher-end setups that can run higher resolutions and eye-candy settings. All of these are true quad-core chips that are capable of processing four simultaneous threads.\n\nUpvote ·\n92\n\n[![Profile photo for Drazen Zoric](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-1127541353-50-kijcbkutfpvmpnjfazckwhagiqukwnfm.jpeg)](https://www.quora.com/profile/Drazen-Zoric)\n\n[Drazen Zoric](https://www.quora.com/profile/Drazen-Zoric)\n\nLives in Cork, Ireland · Author has 7.6K answers and 19M answer views\n\n·\xa0[3y](https://www.quora.com/How-does-Intel-claim-the-Core-i9-12900K-is-the-worlds-best-gaming-processor/answer/Drazen-Zoric)\n\nRelated\n\nHow does Intel claim the Core i9 12900K is the world\'s best gaming processor?\n\nWell do you remember what Apple said when released M1 and recently M1 Max?\n\nWhat happened after few weeks when people tested them?\n\nSame for Intel.

I\'ve compiled a few links below talking about different aspects of this issue.\n\nThe overall issue manifests as spontaneous rebooting, blue screens, or apps that crash to desktop at random intervals; and particularly hard hit seem to be software that does decompression - whether it\'s a game doing texture "stuff", or 7-zip or those types of applications. Intel has released updated power / voltage recommendations for motherboard vendors, but that doesn\'t appear to have addressed the issue.\n\nIntel is also reported to be fielding a very high level of RMA for these processors; and it\'s specifically the i9 (highest clocked, highest core count) processors. The 12th gen does not appear to be affected, and the 13th and 14th gen i7s only seem to be mildly affected (not nearly as clearly as the i9). In 13th and 14th gen, the i7 is lower clocked and has 8 performance + 8 efficient cores, while the i9s are 8+16.\n\nInformational/source links are below. I\'ve summarized take-aways for each link:\n\nGame Developer(s) indicating that >80% of all reported crashes in their games occur on these specific processors:\n\n![www.theregister.com](https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/01/12/chip_shutterstock.jpg)\n\n### [Intel accused of selling ‘defective’ Raptor Lake CPUs](https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/13/game_raptor_intel/)\n\nHigh-end processor instability headaches, failures pushed one studio to switch to AMD\n\n![www.theregister.com](https://www.theregister.com/design_picker/13249a2e80709c7ff2e57dd3d49801cd534f2094/graphics/favicons/favicon.ico)\nwww.theregister.com\n\n\n![alderongames.com](https://alderongames.com/images/og/og-default-pot.png)\n\n### [Intel is selling defective CPUs - Alderon Games](https://alderongames.com/intel-crashes)\n\nWe have been encountering significant problems with Intel CPU stability.

Game Servers love single threaded performance which is why they\'ve been using Core i9. Worth noting is they tend to use "W" / workstation chipsets, that will not expose these processors to very high power limit levels like consumer boards.

Sometimes it\'s an e-core(cluster) or a p-core that can be removed to bring back stability to the CPU.\n\nJust a comment on voltages - while the consumer boards definitely overvolted a bit too much when hitting 5.8, 6.0, and 6.2 GHz on 1-2 cores.. The i9s (13900K, 14900K, 14900KS respectively) require something on the order of 1.5V out of the box.\n\nThe main difference between the server boards and consumer is the total amperage draw is more limited, effectively reducing local heat spots. The actual voltage limits of the server boards could be +/- consumer boards; less because no OC profiles are needed, but equal or more if they want to ensure stability at ~ 6 GHz \\* 1-2 core workloads. Even muddier is servers could actually run hotter than consumer PCs because of density requirements offsetting lower maximum power draw.\n\n..\n\nIf the problem is temperature - servers and consumer will probably fail about the same rate. If it\'s about core counts - i9 will fail first. If it\'s about total power draw (local hotspots) - consumers should fail more than servers. If it\'s about voltage or frequency - then consumers and servers should fail about the same rate.\n\n[N](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php?members/nghanayem.170880/)\n\n#### [nghanayem](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php?members/nghanayem.170880/)\n\n##### Well-known member\n\n> [lefty said:](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php?goto/post&id=72051)\n>\n> They are run on the same node as Alder lake.

Presumably mobile is all RPL since the power consumption dropped so much for all skus going from 12-13th gen. I also wouldn\'t be shocked if over time more of the 13th gen and maybe all of the 14th gen mainstream CPUs were all RPL si to give it that little extra. It is also worth noting that depending on what changed process side, the CPUs can be on the new process with no stepping change and all that would be missing is the small RPL design enhancements (which might be the RC for the small perf and power deltas between different 13400Fs). Given the strict reliability requirements and higher operating temps you would think that EMR qual would have found any issues with changes made going from intel 7 to intel 7+ if they existed.\n\n[I](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php?members/iancutress.332971/)\n\n#### [IanCutress](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php?members/iancutress.332971/)\n\n##### Member\n\nWendell and I spoke about this in our latest podcast.

It happens even on non-K/KS, even in stable environments. Wendell and I discussed privately about electromigration and degradation, but I\'m starting to wonder if it\'s more physical than that.\n\n2\\. The socket latch has long been a point of concern for thermals. Lots of pins, not a lot of uniform pressure. If ground pins aren\'t connecting, that increases issues even if the CPU still works due to resistance/impedance.\n\n3\\. Not only that, but the physical warpage of the CPU over time. We were seeing overclockers having issues with the default socket latch on day one, causing motherboards and CPUs to bend.\n\n4\\. If the silicon inside is feeling torque due to anticlastic deformation via the socket, that could cause non-regular issues long-term that are hard to pin down in software. A symptom of that could be increased electromigration, making the chip design not the cause, but the socket.\n\n5\\. This means that the silicon in the chip could be experiencing deformation at a fundamental level. Power and data connections, if brittle enough, could increase resistance due to deformation. Normally this isn\'t an issue in regular use, but neither is it tested for in validation.\n\n6\\. I should stress I have no data to back this up, aside from the seemingly unfocused nature of the errors affecting all systems, inc non-K and T, and even in underclocked environments focused on stability. The fact it\'s more of a thing now is a factor of time.\n\n7\\. We\'re seeing more high-end CPUs because of the fact that those units typically need more mounting pressure, or might use boards without a mounting plate. The cooling requirements are higher, the current draw is higher, so any shear twist or torque will exacerbate over time.\n\n8\\. This is one of the many reasons why we love sockets that apply equal pressure.\n\nSimply put, if electromigration is happening, it\'s a symptom rather than a cause. It\'s on the low end SKUs as well, even stable ones.\n\nWhy not Alder (12th Gen) over Raptor?

I think the Intel challenge is going to be how to react and the PR to the reaction.\n\nIn reality, Intel could ignore the whole thing and 99% of PC users will be unaffected or not know there is an issue. move on to the next node, take the PR hit now, Fix arrow lake. RMA bad units without pushback. "stop driving in the rear view mirror". I think this is where Intel will go (And I think it is correct).\n\nHowever if it gets to the point where it IS impacting Arrow lake sales, moves to AMD, then Intel will have to respond and the reaction will be "too slow to respond" and severe brand impact.

This issue is not just affecting gamers; it’s raising alarms within the gaming community and prompting several developers, including Epic Games, to take action.\n\nThese crashes often manifest as error messages indicating \'out of video memory,\' unexpectedly closing games, or even freezing systems entirely. The development teams behind popular games have begun advising users on how to mitigate problems linked to these processors. Epic Games has acknowledged the situation, stating they are working together with Intel to identify solutions and assist gamers experiencing these frustrating issues.\n\nReports suggest the root cause may stem from the acceleration settings set by motherboard manufacturers, which are known to push the power limits of these high-end processors beyond their specifications. Sentiments echoed by users indicate frustration over experiencing performance drops when changing these settings to improve stability.\n\nIntel confirmed they are aware of the problem and have started investigating the situation with major affiliates. "Intel is aware of problems related to executing specific tasks on 13th and 14th generation core processors for desktop PCs," said Intel spokesperson, confirming the undertaking of necessary analyses.\n\nEpic Games has provided clear recommendations for users, particularly stating the need to adjust their BIOS settings. Suggestions include changing the SVID Behavior setting to "Intel Fail Safe" to prevent potential overclocking issues which can lead to instability. This BIOS adjustment, which can be done on Asus, MSI, and Gigabyte motherboards, is intended to set power limits back to safer levels.\n\nFor many gamers, these BIOS settings to revert back to factory defaults are considered cumbersome. Many have opted to downclock or undervolt their processors using Intel’s Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU), resulting in noticeable improvements on system stability but at the cost of performance—a hit not all are willing to take. Some gaming studios have gone as far as advising players to switch to AMD processors altogether, reflecting the severity and urgency of the issue.\n\nComputer builders like Power GPU and others have also suggested tweaking high load settings to stabilize performance during intense gaming sessions. The well-known guideline to turn down the performance core multiplier by one or two notches can prevent many crashes. Despite these adjustment measures, the issue of stability persists, and users are still left to navigate the complex BIOS settings of their motherboards to seek stability.\n\nNotably, instances of people returning their Intel CPUs for AMD alternatives have become increasingly common, as daily reports from Korea suggest around ten returns per day just from pre-built systems advertising these problematic CPUs. Such trends may have factored heavily, pressuring Intel to finally take action on the situation instead of dismissing user reports as isolated incidents.\n\nDevelopers behind varied titles have echoed similar reports, stating issues are not solely restricted to one game. Titles such as _Hogwarts Legacy_, _Remnant 2_, and others have been affected. Fatshark, responsible for the _Vermintide_ series, advised players to adjust clock settings, cautioning against playing under high-stress conditions where overloading is likely.\n\nGame developers mentioned the need for optimizing performance particularly during shader compiling—a process known to heat up CPUs and disrupt performance stability. This unexpected crunch leads to higher power consumption, generating strain and chaos within the gaming experience.\n\nThese reports have led to potential repercussions for Intel, as multiple sources indicate law firms are beginning class-action lawsuit investigations related to the performance issues of the latest Core processors. The community may feel compelled to take legal action as the concerns about product reliability intensify.\n\nMeanwhile, the loyal fanbase of Intel CPUs is waiting to see how the tech giant will respond to these developments. There remains hope for swift resolution, especially as many Intel enthusiasts hold out for the release of the upcoming Arrow Lake-S desktop CPUs, but the sentiment of loss of confidence among users continues to grow each day.\n\nWith the gaming world constantly evolving and demanding higher standards and performances from technology, ensuring chip stability needs to be of utmost priority. This stabilizing act is not merely about fixing the current problems; it’s about restoring trust with consumers and maintaining competitive advantage.\n\nIntel’s troubleshooting does not stop here; the company continues to work closely with gaming studios, motherboard manufacturers, and the gaming community to support users stuck amid these technical issues. There’s much at stake for all players involved as the timeline for better solutions and stability measures begins to draw closer.\n\nWhile hardware and software issues are common within the tech world, the most recent challenges faced by Intel exemplify the delicate balance of power and performance. Just as the gaming community continues to adapt and push for better experiences, so too must industry leaders like Intel step up to the plate with their innovations and support frameworks for their technologies.\n\nWith enthusiasts and professionals alike rallying for clarity, it’s clear: Intel must take concrete steps to address and resolve these performance snags. Anything short of appropriate action risks alienation from its userbase as developers also keep close tabs on the debacle. The coming months will be pivotal for Intel, and only time will tell if they will regain the gamer’s confidence once lost amid these high-stakes crashes.\n\nSources\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/intel-is-investigating-game-crashes-on-top-end-core-i9-desktop-cpus/](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/intel-is-investigating-game-crashes-on-top-end-core-i9-desktop-cpus/)\n\n[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-guidelines-frequent-crashes-ifortnite-intel-14th-gen-13th-gen-cpus/](https://wccftech.com/epic-games-guidelines-frequent-crashes-ifortnite-intel-14th-gen-13th-gen-cpus/)\n\n[https://www.pcgamer.com/there-are-increased-reports-of-crashing-in-unreal-engine-games-etc-and-epic-is-blaming-intel-chips/](https://www.pcgamer.com/there-are-increased-reports-of-crashing-in-unreal-engine-games-etc-and-epic-is-blaming-intel-chips/)\n\n[https://www.techspot.com/news/102555-intel-finally-investigating-reports-high-end-13th-14th.html](https://www.techspot.com/news/102555-intel-finally-investigating-reports-high-end-13th-14th.html)\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125036/intel-game-crash-13900k-14900k-fortnite-unreal-engine-investigation](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125036/intel-game-crash-13900k-14900k-fortnite-unreal-engine-investigation)\n\nstatic.virgul.com\n\n# static.virgul.com is blocked\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n- Try disabling your extensions.\n\nERR\\_BLOCKED\\_BY\\_CLIENT\n\nReload\n\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nmc.yandex.com\n\n# mc.yandex.com is blocked\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n- Try disabling your extensions.\n\nERR\\_BLOCKED\\_BY\\_CLIENT\n\nReload\n\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)', 'metadata': {'twitter:description': 'Intel is facing mounting scrutiny as reports pile up about its top-tier CPUs, particularly the Core i9-13900K and i9-14900K, experiencing frequent crashes during…', 'fb:pages': '163940083664075', 'og:image': 'https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/6kIfnYbj3Bf0Cw1AS7CYCdua4Hg=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F8c94fe4d-a291-416a-bdfa-50d54cb8dd58.jpeg', 'msapplication-TileColor': ['#ffffff', '#ffffff'], 'google-site-verification': 'Tcg4zXyANfgpT7caz9CbSI34Bjoj8gj5qGzC35TE5jw', 'twitter:title': 'Intel Faces Backlash Over Core I9 CPU Crashes', 'ogUrl': 'https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/intel-faces-backlash-over-core-i9-cpu-crashes-6834', 'ogDescription': 'Intel is facing mounting scrutiny as reports pile up about its top-tier CPUs, particularly the Core i9-13900K and i9-14900K, experiencing frequent crashes during…', 'title': 'Intel Faces Backlash Over Core I9 CPU Crashes -
