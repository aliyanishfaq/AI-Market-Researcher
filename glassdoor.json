Managers can manage many sub-tasks, but each employee who is expected to do 'deep work' should have enough uninterrupted time. Don't waste our time with too many non-productive meetings. Any meeting you schedule should have a pre-announced agenda and require only the necessary people with a well-defined outcome."

SMG org has collapsed and its leader is like a cartoon character. CMO has no idea about modern marketing and has zero experience in hardware. The person who caused Data Center Business to collapse has been rewarded to become a CEO of an Intel company while hardest working senior managers were let go. Company has been spending on absurd things but they asked employees to give away %5 to 10% of their salaries. No rewards, promotions or bonuses given in multiple cycles.

No merit rewards, pay is way under compared to the market. High performers will only get promotions if they try to leave the company or if they get lucky with a decent manager.
